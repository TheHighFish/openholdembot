v1.0.6 2008-04-11
-----------------
New stuff
=========
- A new "Network" option is now available which is used by OpenHoldem as the network for
  Poker Tracker data.  This means s$sitename and s$network in the ManualMode table map are
  no longer used for Poker Tracker.  (Thanks, Winngy) (quiqsilver)

Bug fixes
=========
- Added missing keyboard accelerators for some menu items (Thanks, Winngy)  (OpenHoldem)


v1.0.5 2008-03-28
-----------------
- Increment handnumber after reset.  (jumpingfences)
- Allow user to drag modal dialogs away from table window so that they don't interfere 
  with scraping and symbol calculation. (jumpingfences)
- Expose to the scraper all flop cards at the same time as oppose to one by one. (jumpingfences)


v1.0.4 2008-02-08
-----------------
- Updated table map to correctly recognize tournament mode (Thanks Zippy & Winngy)
- WinHoldem/WinScrape profile has *not* been updated as I just don't really care anymore.  This is
  left as an exercise for the reader.


v1.0.3 2008-01-25
-----------------
- Updated table "profile" to a table map.  Both a WinHoldem/WinScrape .ws profile and a OpenHoldem/OpenScrape
  table map are included in the archive.
- Corrected tab order of controls on the stakes dialog.
- In a macro, the "R" no longer resets handnumber, tournament, limit, sblind, bblind, bbet and ante.


v1.0.2 2007-12-14
-----------------
- Macros were not setting common cards correctly (CManualModeDlg::OnBnClickedMacro) (Thanks, radi8tor)


v1.0.1 2007-11-30
-----------------
- Class name of dialog changed to allow detection by OpenHoldem, and subsequent setting of "ismanual" symbol.
