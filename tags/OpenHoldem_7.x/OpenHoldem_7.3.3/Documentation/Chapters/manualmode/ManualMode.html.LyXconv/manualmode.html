</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
ManualMode is a tool for simulating a poker game state offine. It allows you to set any game state you can think of, including your cards, buttons, etc. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A Table Map is included with the ManualMode tool to allow OpenHoldem to connect to the ManualMode main window and scrape the game state 100% correctly into the OpenHoldem engine. This will allow for offline construction of bot logic and the easy setup of various game state situations, some of which are very rare online (think Straight Flushes).
