This is a guide to show you how to get OpenHoldem running securely on a single computer using the VMware Server application as a second, "virtual" computer. Original post by <span class="versalitas">Tammelin</span>n: <a class="FlexURL" href="http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=11894">http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=11894</a>

I am also assuming that you are using the same operating system as me. If you are using Windows XP Media Centre Edition or Windows XP Professional, you can use this guide. If you are using some other brand of Windows (including Vista), the guide might not be reliable. I have only tested these instructions with XP. Most steps also apply to other virtualization software like (<a class="URL" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>), which is a free and equally good alternative, but this guide concentrates on VmWare, which was state of the art when these instructions got written.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The guide assumes no special knowledge, but you will need some basic computer skills. You will need to know how to install software, how to rename files, how to navigate folders and so on. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Much of this information is already available elsewhere. In many cases, all I have done is to reword it a little.

The "real" computer is the one that is sitting on your desk or on your lap. It has its own operating system. The "virtual" computer is the one we are going to create using VMware Server. We can think of the "virtual" computer as a separate computer with its own operating system, even though it is physically part of the "real" computer.

<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2"></a>Step 1 - Download VMware Server 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
VMware Server is a free download from <a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.vmware.com">http://www.vmware.com</a>. You will need to provide VMware with a valid e-mail address to get a serial number. I used version 1.0.3 while writing this guide. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You will also need a Windows installation disk or an ISO-image of e.g. TinyXP. I am using a Windows XP Professional installation DVD, which I’m going to install as my "virtual" operating system. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
While you wait for the download to finish, you should read the whole of this guide and make sure that you understand it. It would be a good idea to print it out, if you can. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>Do not install any software</i> until you are told to. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3"></a>Step 2 - Install VMware Server on your real computer 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Double-click on the VMware Server file you downloaded and it will begin installing itself. When you are asked if you want a "complete" or "custom" installation, choose "complete". A big window with some warnings about "IIS" might appear. We don’t need IIS, so just click “OK”. When the installer asks for Internet access, grant it. Wait for the installation to complete before moving on to the next step. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4"></a>Step 3 - Configure VMware Player 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Double-click on the "VMware Server" icon that should have appeared on the desktop of your real computer. VMware Server will start for the first time. A Pop-up window asks you to choose between a local host and a remote host. Choose "local host" and click "OK". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click the "New Virtual Machine" icon and a window will appear. Choose "typical" and click "next". Now choose which operating system you want to install on your virtual computer. Here, I selected the "Microsoft Windows" option, and the version I selected was "Windows XP, Professional". if you want to install from a CD-image and not from a real CD then just point VMware to the location of the ISO-image.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The next window gives you two boxes to fill in. The first box gives you a chance to name your new virtual computer. Choose any name you like. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The second box ("Location") allows you to choose where the Virtual computer will be saved on your hard drive. You probably don’t need to change the contents of this box. (The virtual computer is actually a single file which exists on the hard drive of your real computer. If you want this file to be in a different folder or even on a different partition, you can tell VMware now.) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Next you must choose the type of <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-network-0" href="#index-network">↓</a>network. Choose "Use bridged networking". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The next window asks you to decide how big the virtual computer’s virtual hard drive is going to be. The suggested 8GB is quite enough for the purposes of playing poker. Click "Finish" when you are ready. Some operating-systems like Windows 2000 or TinyXP will be satisfied with a bit less disk space, but don’t forget that you also need space for casino-software, hand-histories and maybe PokerTracker. Better safe than sorry.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
VMware will thereafter spend quite a few minutes creating the virtual computer. Wait until the installation is complete. You should be looking at a brand-new installation of Windows XP. If you can run Solitaire (click "Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire") then you are ready to move on to the next step.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-5"></a>Step 4 - Install an <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-operating-system-0" href="#index-operating-system">↓</a>operating system on the virtual computer
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
When VMware is ready, you’ll see a new window with some details about the virtual computer. Find "Start this virtual machine" on the left and click it. VMware will now look for the Windows installation disk in your CD/DVD drive. Put the installation disk in the drive and Windows will begin installing onto your virtual computer. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Soon, Windows will ask you if you want to format your hard drive. Only the virtual hard drive of the virtual computer is going to get formatted, so you don’t need to worry about the data on your real hard drive. It is perfectly safe. If you asked how you want to format the virtual hard drive, make sure you choose one of the NTFS options. (Do not choose any option with FAT16 or FAT32). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Eventually, Windows will ask you to enter your full name. We are going to create three seperate users, so choose a name for the first user ("Jessica", for example) and enter it here. This user will have permanent administrator privileges. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Next, enter an administrator password for this user. Write down the name and password now. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>Administrator name and password</i> _________________________ 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Later, Windows will ask you to enter up to five user names. The first user - the box labelled "your name" - should be the same as the user you entered above ("Jessica"). Don’t fill in the other boxes yet. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Wait until the installation is complete. You should be looking at a brand-new installation of Windows XP. If you can run Solitaire (click "Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire") then you are ready to move on to the next step. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-6"></a>Step 5 - Install VMTools, <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Firewall-0" href="#index-Firewall">↓</a>Firewall and <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Antivirus-0" href="#index-Antivirus">↓</a>Antivirus on virtual computer 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
VMTools is a package which, among other things, gets the mouse to move smoothly between the real and the virtual computer. You need to install it now, so press CTRL+ALT to restore mouse control to the real computer. Then, on the VMware Server window, click on the menu option VM, and then choose "Install VMTools..." VMTools will now install itself inside the virtual computer. The virtual computer will need to reboot. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
After the reboot, find the VMTools icon in the system tray, next to the clock. It looks like three small interlinked squares. When you have found it, double-click on it. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A window appears and the "Options" tab is already showing. Find the line "Show VMware Tools in the taskbar" and click on it, so that there is no longer a tick next to it. Click “OK” to save your changes. This measure prevents the casino from seeing that you’re using VMware - just in case they take a screenshot of your desktop. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now, your virtual computer is connected to the Internet, so it needs firewall software and antivirus software, just as your real computer does. Install the software (connect to the Internet to download it, if you have to), and then run a scan to check that your virtual computer is free from viruses. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
(You could use AVG Antivirus (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://free.grisoft.com">http://free.grisoft.com</a>), and Zonealarm Firewall (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.zonealarm.com">http://www.zonealarm.com</a>)) 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7"></a>Step 6 - Check that the real and virtual computers can communicate
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If the real computer and the virtual computer can’t communicate with each other, all your efforts in securing them will be wasted. Let’s check the communications now. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The traditional way to test a network is to have one computer "ping" the other. A ping is a short signal which one computer sends to another. The signal will get bounced back if the network is running as it should. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Before pinging anything, you need to turn off the firewalls on both computers. If you have installed a firewall such as Zonealarm, switch it off. Now click "Start - Control Panel - Security Centre". At the bottom of the window is an option to "Manage security settings for: Windows Firewall". Click on "Windows Firewall" and make sure it is off. Do this on both computers. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now you need to find out the IP address for both computers. (An IP address is a numerical address which computers on a network use to identify each other.) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On your real computer, click "Start - Run". Type "cmd" in the box and press return. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A new window appears. Type “ipconfig" and press return. You will see a series of numbers, some of which are marked "IP address". Find the one that corresponds to the type of Internet connection you have - for example, the one labeled "wireless connection" if you connect to the Internet through a wireless router. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The IP address of my real computer is 192.168.1.4 - yours probably looks almost the same. Write it down now. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>Real computer IP address</i>_________________________ 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now do the same thing on your virtual computer. Find the IP address and write it down. The IP address of my virtual computer is 192.168.1.7 - yours will be similar. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>Virtual computer IP address</i> _________________________ 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On your real computer, find the new window again and type "ping x.x.x.x", then press return. Replace x.x.x.x with the IP address of your virtual computer. You should see something like this... 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">Pinging 192.168.1.7 with 32 bytes of data:

</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
This dialogue means that the real computer sent a signal to the virtual computer four times, and each time it got a response. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If the network isn’t set up properly, you will see something like this... 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">

</div>
<div class="Indented">
This dialogue means that the real computer sent a signal to the virtual computer four times, but received no response. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Go to your virtual computer and do the same thing. This time, type "ping x.x.x.x" replacing x.x.x.x with the IP address of your real computer. If you get a response, your network is set up properly and you can continue to the next step. If the network isn’t set up properly, you should seek help from someone who understands networks. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Don’t forget to <i>turn your firewalls back on again</i> when you finish this step. If you have a good firewall such as Zonealarm, you can leave the less powerful Windows firewall turned off permanently (on your real computer as well as your virtual computer). 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-8"></a>Step 7 - Set up user accounts on virtual computer 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Click "Start - Control Panel - User Accounts". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You had already set up one user while installing Windows. This user already has admin privileges. We’ll call it the "admin" user. We need to give this user a password. It can be the same password you used in step 4. Click on the user, then click on "create a password". Enter the password into the boxes and click on "create password". The next window asks you if you want to make your files and folders private. You certainly do, so click "Yes, make private". Click on "Back" to return to the user accounts window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now we’ll set up two new users with fewer privileges. You will be logged in as the second user whenever you connect to a casino. We’ll call this the "casino" user. The third user will be created to hide things from the casino. We’ll call this the "stealth" user. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Choose names and passwords for these users, and write them all down now. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<table>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<i>Admin user</i>
</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">
_________________________

</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<i>Casino user</i>

</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<i>Stealth user</i>
</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">
_________________________
</td>

</tr>

</table>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
The casino user will have restricted privileges initially. Click "create a new account", enter the name of the casino user and click "next". Click on "limited" and then click on "create account". The casino user will appear next to the admin user. Click on the casino user and give it a password. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The stealth user will have restricted privileges permanently. Click "create a new account" and set up the stealth user in the same way you set up the casino user. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click "create a new account". Choose a name and then click on "limited account". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
That completes this step. If there is a "guest" user shown, you can ignore it. Close the "user accounts" window. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-9"></a>Step 8 - Create a protected folder on virtual computer 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You should still be logged in as the admin user. Stay logged in as this user throughout step 8. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We need to create a folder to hide some sensitive information. The best place for this folder is inside the root folder (click Start - My Computer - Local Disk C:. Then click on "show contents of this folder"). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Create a new folder in this window and give it an innocent name. ("Files" would be a good name.) From now on, this folder will be referred to as the "Ninja" folder. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click "Start - Control Panel - (Appearances and Themes) - Folder Options". Click the "View" tab. In the "Advanced Settings" window, find the line "Use simple file sharing (recommended)". If there is a green tick on this line, click on it to remove it. Click on the big "OK" button to save your changes. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now, right click on the Ninja folder and choose "Properties". Click on the "Security" tab. In the "Group or user names" box you will see a list of users, but the stealth user should not be one of them. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We want to change the folder’s settings so that the stealth user is the only user who can see inside it. (Not even users with admin privileges should be able to see inside.) Click the “Add" button. In the "Enter the object names to select" box, type in the name of the stealth user (for example, my stealth user is called James). Click the "OK" button. There should now be a new entry in the list. My stealth user shows up as “James (XPPRO/James)" in that list. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now we need to remove every user except the stealth user from the list. Click the "Advanced" button. Find the line which says "Inherit from parent the permission entries..." and click on it. A warning pop-up appears; click on the "Remove" button. The line which says "Inherit from parent the permission entries..." should no longer have a tick next to it. Click the “OK” button. Another warning pop-up might appear. If it does, click "Remove", then “OK”. The list of users should now have only one user in it, the stealth user. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Find the "Full control" line. In the "allow" column, there is a small box. Click on it, and a column full of ticks will appear. If everything has gone to plan, there will be one user with full control over the Ninja folder. If you’re happy, click "OK". If something seems to be wrong, click "Cancel" and go through the last two paragraphs again. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-10"></a>Step 9 - Take charge of the protected folder
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Log out from the admin user account and login as the stealth user (click Start - Log off - Switch User). Go to "My Computer" again and find the Ninja folder. Right click on the folder and choose "Properties". Click on the "Security" tab. Check that the stealth user is still the only user in the list. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click the "Advanced" button and click the "Owner" tab. Left click once on the stealth user so that it changes colour to blue. Find the "Replace owner..." line and click on it, so that a green tick appears next to it. Then click on "Apply". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The user in the box "Current owner of this item" should have changed to the stealth user. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now click on the "Permissions" tab. Find the "Inherit from the parent permission entries..." line; there should still be no tick next to it. Just below, find the "Replace permission entries on all child objects..." line; click on it so that there is a green tick next to it. Click the "Apply" button. A warning pop-up appears; click the "Yes" button. Click on the “OK” buttons twice to save your changes. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Let’s check that everything is set up correctly. The stealth user is the only one who should be able to see the Ninja folder and <i>anything</i> it contains. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Open the Ninja folder (by double clicking on it) and create a folder called "test" inside it. Right click on the "test" folder, choose "Properties" and click on the "Security" tab. If the stealth user is the only person in the list, everything is as it should be. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Close all the windows and log out from the stealth user account. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-11"></a>Step 10 - One more check 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Log in as the admin user. Find the Ninja folder, and try to look inside it. Your attempt to see inside this protected folder should be denied. When you run casino software, it will not be able to see inside this folder (unless it tries to take ownership of the folder - but this would be a <i>criminal</i> act.) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This setup is not 100% secure, but it is probably secure enough. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-12"></a>Step 11 - Install <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Bring-0" href="#index-Bring">↓</a>Bring on your virtual computer
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You now have a real computer and a virtual computer. OpenHoldem is going to run on the real computer. The casino software is going to run on the virtual computer. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now you need to install some software that will allow OpenHoldem (on the real computer) to see what the casino software (on the virtual computer) is doing. There are several ways of doing this. We are going to use a piece of software called "Bring". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the virtual computer, log in as the stealth user. Now go to the official WinHoldem site (See {Bring}) and download "bring.exe" (from the "stealth" page). Download it directly into the Ninja folder: <a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.winholdem.net/bring/">http://www.winholdem.net/bring/</a>. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The casino software can’t see inside the Ninja folder, but it will be able to see Bring being run as a process. (If you want to see all the processes your computer is running, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and then click on the "processes" tab.) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The solution is to rename Bring to something more innocent. Then, if the casino software looks at the processes you are running, it won’t be able to find out anything incriminating about Bring. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Rename Bring now. For example, you could rename it to "notepad" or “paint". 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-13"></a>Step 12 - Install <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-software-0" href="#index-software">↓</a>software on your real computer
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You can now install Bring on your real computer. You don’t need to rename it; the casino cannot see what is happening on your real computer. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Open a folder on the desktop, call it "Bring", and download into it the files "bring.exe" and “bring.ini". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click "Start - Control Panel - Folder Options". Click the "View" tab. In the box labeled "Advanced Settings", scroll down and find the line "Hide extensions for known file types". If there is a green tick next to this line, click on it to make the tick disappear. Click "OK” to save your changes. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You should also install OpenHoldem on your real computer now if you haven’t already. <i>Do not install OpenHoldem on your virtual computer.</i>
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-14"></a>Step 13 - Configure Bring 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Do you remember the IP address of your virtual computer? You’re going to need it again now. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On your real computer, go into the "Bring" folder you just created and open the file "bring.ini" in a text editor. (Right-click on “bring.ini”, choose "Open with..." and select "Notepad".) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Find the following lines:

<ul>
<li>
x.x.x.x should be the IP address of your virtual computer.

eeee is the "port" number. It can be a number of your own choice. 80 would be a good choice, and so would 800, 5000 or 8080. 
</li>
<li>
"secret" is a password. It’s not a good password, but it is fine for the purposes of testing Bring. 
</li>

</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Now we’re going to test Bring by playing a game of solitaire on the virtual computer, and by attempting to control it from the real computer. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Go to the virtual computer. You should still be logged in as the stealth user. Start the Solitaire programme ("Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire"). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now open another command prompt (click "Start - Run", type "cmd" and press enter). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The command prompt window is currently looking at the "My Documents" folder. You need to move into the Ninja folder. If you followed the earlier suggestion, the location of your Ninja folder will be "C:\files". To move into this folder, simply type “CD C:\files" and press return. (If this doesn’t work you will need to learn how to use the command prompt. Do an Internet search for "DOS command prompt".) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now type the following command and press return. Instead of bring, you should type the name of your renamed file. Instead of 80, you should type the port number you chose in the previous step, and instead of "secret" you should type the password you chose. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">bring -s 80 secret

Now go to your real computer. Go into the Bring folder and double click on "bring.exe". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another pop-up appears to show you that Bring has started on your real computer. Click “OK”. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another window appears labeled "Select remote connection". You should see a line that looks exactly like the line you entered in the "bring.ini" file. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">a 192.168.1.7 80 secret

</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click on this line so that it turns blue, and click the "OK" button. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another window appears with a list of programs that are currently running on your virtual computer. One of them should be solitaire, so click on it so that it turns blue and then click the "OK" button. Solitaire will launch on your real computer, and if everything is set up correctly, you will be able to play it and watch your mouse clicks affecting both computers at once! 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you are unable to control solitaire from your real computer you definitely won’t be able to control a poker table. Before you continue, seek help from someone who understands networks.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-16"></a>Step 15 - Stop running Bring 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
When you have had enough of playing solitaire, you should shut down Bring. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the real computer, just close the solitaire window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the virtual computer, there are three ways to stop Bring. 
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Log off 
</li>
<li>
Stop the Bring process. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL. Two task manager windows will appear, one for the real computer and one for the virtual computer. Find the task manager on the virtual computer and click the "Processes" tab, find “bring.exe" (however you renamed it), click on it to turn it blue, and then click on "End Process". 
</li>
<li>
Lock the desktop. This doesn’t actually close Bring, but it does halt it and prevent your real computer from communicating with it. 
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
Stop Bring on both computers before you move on to the next step. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-17"></a>Step 16 - Set up the "run as a different user" facility 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
When you connect to the casino’s Internet site you should always be logged into your virtual computer as the casino user. However, you will be running Bring <i>as if</i> you will logged on as the stealth user. In this way, the casino won’t be able to detect that you are using Bring. Here’s how to do it. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the virtual computer, log in as the casino user. Right-click on the desktop and choose "New", then choose "Shortcut". A window will appear. In the box, type "cmd". Click "Next" and then click "Finish". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A new icon, “cmd.exe", will have appeared on your desktop. It’s actually a shortcut to the command prompt that you have used a few times before. Right-click on this shortcut and choose "Properties". A window appears and the "Shortcut" tab should already be showing. Click the "Advanced" button. Find the line which reads "Run with different credentials". Click on it so that a tick appears next to it. Click the "OK" buttons twice. "Run with different credentials" actually means "run this program as a different user". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Start solitaire again. Double click the “cmd.exe" shortcut and a window will appear, asking you which user you want to use to run the program. Click on the line "The following user". Then, enter the stealth user’s name and password, and click “OK". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The command prompt window appears. It is running as if you were logged in as the stealth user. We can safely run Bring from this window. Go into the Ninja folder (perhaps by typing "CD C:\files”). Type the following command, changing the words "bring", "80" and "secret" exactly as you did in step 14. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">bring -s 80 secret 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Bring’s pop-up window appears, so click the “OK” button. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now go to the real computer and start Bring there. Try to open the solitaire window, just as you did before. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Go back to the virtual computer. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to make the task manager appear in both windows. Find the virtual computer’s task manager and select the "Properties" tab. Check that "bring.exe" (however you renamed it) is running under the stealth user, even though you are logged in as the casino user. Check that "sol.exe" - the solitaire process - is running under the casino user. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-18"></a>Step 17 - Check security with <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Gaze-0" href="#index-Gaze">↓</a>Gaze 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
We’re going to make one more security check using the program Gaze. It can be downloaded from the forums at the WinHoldem official site. (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=1114">http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=1114</a>)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Still on the virtual computer and still logged in as the casino user, go to the WinHoldem site. There should be two files - "gaze.cpp" and “gaze.exe". Download both of them to the virtual computer’s desktop. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Double click on “gaze.exe” to run it. A window will appear, and shortly afterwards a pop-up labeled "Windows - no disk" will appear. Click the "Cancel" button, and close the Gaze window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The results of the test have been saved to a file on the desktop called "gaze”. Confusingly, there are now two text files on the desktop with the same name. Double click one of them to open it in a text editor. If the first few lines don’t look like this, you’ve got the wrong file.

If you can see the message "OpenProcess failed with error 5 (Access is denied)", then you will know for sure that the casino user can’t find out anything incriminating about Bring. Your security checks are now complete. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Close Notepad, solitaire and the “cmd.exe" shortcut. Delete Gaze from your desktop and empty the recycle bin. Terminate the Bring process. Reboot the virtual computer.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-19"></a>Step 18 - Install the <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-casino-software-0" href="#index-casino-software">↓</a>casino software 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You can now install the casino software. On the virtual computer, log in as the casino user. Create a new folder on the desktop called "poker". It’s a good idea to install all your casino software in a single folder. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The casino user currently has restricted privileges. Some casinos insist that you install their software when logged in as a user with administrative privileges. Some casinos also insist that you run their software when logged in as a user with administrative privileges. Preferably, we would like to install and run the software while logged in as a user has restricted privileges. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here is how to set up a typical casino’s poker software. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Still logged in as the casino user, go to the casino web site. Download their software directly into the poker folder you created moments ago. Go into the folder and double click on the software. It will begin installing. When the install asks where you would like to install the software, choose the "poker" folder you created moments ago. Don’t let the install the use the default folder. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If the installation completes without complaints, all is well. However, if the installation complaints that it needs administrative privileges, this is what you must do: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Log out from the casino user’s account and log in to the admin user’s account. Open the "User Accounts" window just as you did before. Click on the casino user act and then click on "Change the account type". Click on "Computer Administrator" and then click the "Change Account Type" button. Log out from the admin user’s account and log back into the casino user’s account. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Try to install the software again. This time it should install without complaints. Now log out of the casino user’s account and go back to the admin user account. Change the casino user’s account type back to "limited". Log out of the admin user account and log back into the casino user’s account. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now try running the software. If the software complaints that it needs administrative privileges to run, change the casino user’s account to "Computer Administrator" just as you did above. It’s unfortunate that you have to run the software with administrative privileges, but it’s not the end of the world.

<div class="Unindented">
OpenHoldem is quite fussy about which desktop theme you are using. Currently, only the <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-XP-0" href="#index-Windows-XP">↓</a>Windows XP default style and the <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-2000-0" href="#index-Windows-2000">↓</a>Windows 2000 <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-classic-style-0" href="#index-classic-style">↓</a>classic style are supported.

Click "Start - Control Panel - (Appearances and Themes) - Change the computer’s theme" to do this.
