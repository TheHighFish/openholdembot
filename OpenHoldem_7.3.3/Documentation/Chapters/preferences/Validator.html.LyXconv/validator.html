</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Validator preferences control various aspects of OpenHoldem’s Validator engine. See the {Validator} section for more information. The purpose of the Validator is to help people to develop more reliable bots and Table Maps. It will execute several hundred <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Consistency-checks-0" href="#index-Consistency-checks">↓</a>consistency-checks at the symbol level to detect invalid game-states, <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Mis-scrapes-0" href="#index-Mis-scrapes">↓</a>mis-scrapes or incomplete information. The Validator will write possible problems to the log-file and also show a message box, as long as messages are not disabled. The rules used by the Validator are always being refined and developed. The discussion forum is the best place to keep on top of this (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=189 ">http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=189 </a>).

<ul>
<li>
<i>Enable Validator</i>: This preference determines when the Validator is engaged to do its work, either never (completely off), when it is my turn, or always.
</li>
<li>
<i>Use Heuristic Rules</i>: Some rules are heuristic, i.e. they are "common sense", but not always true. Example: A game does usually not last longer than 2 minutes, so the autoplayer has to act at least once per 120 seconds. If it does not do so, there seems to be a problem. Maybe the Table Map does not detect the players cards or the buttons. This setting can result in false positives and is recommended for testing only, but not for real-money-play. 
</li>
<li>
<i>Stop Autoplayer on error</i>: If the Validator discovers an inconsistency, and this preference is checked, the <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Autoplayer-0" href="#index-Autoplayer">↓</a>Autoplayer will be instructed to stop autoplaying. 
</li>
<li>
<i>Shoot replay-frame on error: </i>If the Validator discovers an inconsistency, and this preference is checked, OpenHoldem will shoot a <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-replay-0" href="#index-replay">↓</a>replay-frame and store it in the replay-folder. The replay frame will help you to find the source of the error.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
It is never a bad idea to use the validator some time for testing new tablemaps. We recommend to enable it at your turn, because when it is your time to act reliable input is most important, and at that point of time you can also expect to get stable input from the casino. Give it a try, but be prepared — the validator is a little bitch!
