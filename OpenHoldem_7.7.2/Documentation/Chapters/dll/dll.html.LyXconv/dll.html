</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
OpenHoldem has the ability to interface with a user-compiled DLL. Microsoft Windows provides a feature whereby running code can load other code, presuming that code is provided in the form of DLL files. OpenHoldem utilizes this Windows DLL feature to allow you to extend the functions within OpenHoldem to practically anything that you want, provided you can write the code for it and compile it. Generally, people who create DLLs write them in the C or C++, as those are the native historical target languages for using DLL functions, as defined by Microsoft. There are ways to have OpenHoldem use a C/C++ DLL shell which then calls code written in other languages, such as managed languages like .NET, but that topic is beyond the scope of this manual. If you are interested in doing this, there are some topics in our C++ subforum that talk about utilizing other languages.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
OpenHoldem provides a number of preferences for how a user-DLL will be loaded. It can be done on start-up, when a formula is loaded, or manually. See the {Preferences} section for more information.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
From this point on, the assumption is that, if you are creating a user-DLL, it will be written in the C or C++ languages. To do this, you need a C/C++ compiler — the express editions of Microsoft Visual Studio will suffice for this, as these user-DLLs typically do not need the MFC library, which is only present in the paid versions of Microsoft Visual Studio. A starting framework for a user-DLL can be found in the source code library on Google Code, but is also embedded just below this paragraph. See the {References} section for links.
</div>
<h2 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1"></a>How OpenHoldem and the DLL cooperate 
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The OpenHoldem to DLL interface is small and clean. OpenHoldem exports the following functions and the DLL gets linked to them at load-time.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">// Functions exported by OpenHoldem 
extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) double __stdcall GetSymbolFromDll(const int chair, const char* name, bool&amp; iserr); 
extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) void __stdcall SendChatMessageFomDll(const char *msg); 
extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) void* __stdcall GetPhl1kFromDll(); 
extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) void* __stdcall GetPrw1326FromDll(); 
extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) void __stdcall WriteLogFromDll(char* fmt, ...); extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) char* __stdcall GetHandnumberFromDll();
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
And the DLL will export a function too, namely
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">__declspec(dllexport) double process_message( const char* message, const void* param );
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Again linking happens at load-time, so the DLL-interface is ready for cooperation right from the start. Contrary to WinHoldem and early versions of OpenHoldem no function-pointer get exchanged at run-time, so a very error-prone mechanism could get removed.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
OpenHoldem will send or request information from the DLL when needed, and it is up to the DLL’s author to process these requests. The exported library function process_message is used for this interface and has the following prototype:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">USERDLL_API double process_message (const char* pmessage, const void* param);
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
The various messages that can be passed in the “pmessage” parameter are as follows: pmessage meaning and parameters state 
</div>
<h4 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-1"></a>Game-States
</h4>
<div class="Unindented">
Each scrape cycle, OpenHoldem will send the current game state to the DLL. As the author of the DLL, you will decide what to do with this game state information. The game state information is stored in a structure within OpenHoldem, and a pointer to this structure is passed to your User DLL in the “param” parameter. An example of how to cast this void pointer to the game state structure is provided in the Reference User DLL source code. The details of what is included in this game state structure are in the header file in the Reference User DLL source code. 
</div>
<h4 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-2"></a>Querying dll$-Symbols
</h4>
<div class="Unindented">
Any symbol that begins with the characters “dll$” is interpreted by the OpenHoldem parser as requiring a call to the loaded User DLL in order to determine its value. The “query” message is the mechanism for requesting the value of this symbol. Any symbol name can be created for use by your User DLL, as long as it begins with “dll$”, and your DLL code knows how to handle it. So, for example, if the OpenHoldem decision engine encounters a symbol called “dll$kill_phil” in the evaluation of the “f$alli” function, then a synchronous call will be made to the User DLL to provide the value of dll$kill_phil in order to complete the evaluation of f$alli. The evaluation of f$alli will block until your DLL handles this request and provides a result. The name of the symbol (in this case, “dll$kill_phil”) is provided in the “param” parameter, and should be cast to a (const char*). A simple example of how to process this message is provided in the Reference User DLL source code. 
</div>
<h4 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3"></a>load and unload Messages
</h4>
<div class="Unindented">
There are two event messages that are passed to your DLL. Both of these messages have NULL “param” parameters. “load” – this message is sent once immediately after your DLL is loaded. Typically this is used for some kind of initialization activity by your DLL. “unload” – this message is sent once just prior to OpenHoldem unloading your DLL from memory. This could be due to OpenHoldem shutdown, manual intervention from the DLL menu, or new formula loading. Typically this is used to clean up your DLL’s activities, such as connections to databases, closure of threads, etc. 
</div>
<h4 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-4"></a>phl1k 
</h4>
<div class="Unindented">
This is a pointer to OpenHoldem’s internal hand list array, for your DLL to read and modify as needed. It points to an array of the following type:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">bool inlist[1000][13][13];
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
OpenHoldem can store 1000 different hand lists, and the first dimension of this array specifies the hand list number, the second and third dimensions specify the rank of the first and second card, where rank0&gt;=rank1 is interpreted to mean suited cards, and rank0&lt;rank1 is interpreted to mean unsuited cards. This is a very sparsely populated array, where the intersection of the three dimensions specifies if the particular card pair is present in the hand list or not. A non-zero value at this intersection indicates that the card pair is present; zero indicates that the card pari is not present. prw1326 This message provides a pointer to a prw1326 structure stored in OpenHoldem. This prw1326 structure is used to describe the manner in which OpenHoldem calculates its prwin, prtie and prlos symbols, based on the information which the DLL developer places in this structure. Unless the DLL code sets a specific enabling flag in this structure, the current prwin, prtie and prlos calculation is unchanged. Please see the {prw1326} section for more information.
</div>
<div class="Remark*">
OpenHoldems handlist-structure got rewritten and OpenHoldem is no longer restricted to 1000 numbered lists. Therefore this paragraph does currently not apply. A new machanism for manipulating handlists will be developed in the near future.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1"></a>A Simple Example
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
An easy way to get started is to override all OH-Script processing with DLL functions. There are a number of reasons to do this, including:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Limitations of the OH-Script language (no assignments is the biggest limitation) 
</li>
<li>
Low level integration with other technologies
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
To override all OH-Script processing, simply instruct each primary function to only have a call to a “dll$” symbol. For example, use the following code:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$alli##
dll$alli
​
##f$rais##
dll$rais
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
And so on. In your User DLL, handle each of these “dll$” symbols as described above. Now all of the decision logic has been moved from OH-Script code to code that you provide in your DLL. It is important to remember that even if you want to code up most of your bot logic in C/C++, you still must use the OpenHoldem primary functions themselves to call this logic.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2"></a>prw1326 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The prw1326 structure and associated individual chair structure have the following specification:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">//prwin 1326 chair structure 
struct sprw1326_chair 
{ 
    int level;  // indicates weighting level

    int ranklo[1326]; // lower ranked card number 
                      // in pocket cards

    sprw1326_chair chair[10]; // structures for each chair 
};
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
To use the structure from a User DLL, the following would also need to be added:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">typedef sprw1326* pp13; pp13 prw1326;
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Also, in the process_message handling add:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">if (strcmp(pmessage,"prw1326")==0) { prw1326 = (pp13)param; return 0; }
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
During OpenHoldem initialization the prw1326.vanilla_chair structure is set up so that .level is 1024, the .ranklo and .rankhi arrays contain the card order used for the normal OpenHoldem prwin calculation (but expanded from 169 to 1326 format), the weighting of the high third of these cards is set to 1024, the middle third is sloped down from 1024 to zero, and .limit is set so that the final third are never even considered as possible opponent cards. The .vanilla_chair is then copied to each of the ten .chair structures. This should mean that even if the capability is activated by setting .useme to 1326, the prwin calculation will not crash and will give an anodyne weighted result. The vanilla_chair is not referenced or used by OpenHoldem other than at start-up, and could be altered and used by the DLL developer to act as a default profile for new players.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3"></a>isfinalanswer 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
isfinalanswer is a calculated symbol, designed for User-DLL developers, who want to make sure, that certain calculations get executed only once per turn. This symbols is true (non-zero) just prior to the Autoplayer acting, and false (zero) any other time. More precise, it is true exactly when
</div>
<ul>
<li>
it is your turn
</li>
<li>
you see stable frames, i.e. when N scrapes is a row are identical (N is set in Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Autoplayer-&gt;Frame Delay)
</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4"></a>dll$iswait 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Prior to the OpenHoldem Autoplayer taking action, it will query your User DLL, if one is loaded, for the value of dll$iswait. If this query returns non-zero, then OpenHoldem will not execute the Autoplayer’s action this scrape cycle, but rather will skip the action and continue to the next screen scrape cycle. While dll$iswait returns non-zero, isfinalanswer will always be zero.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the forum Matrix explained (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=174&amp;t=6885">http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=174&amp;t=6885</a>):
</div>
<blockquote class="Quotation">
While dll$iwait is true you don’t have to respond to formula requests. You do have to somehow make sure that by the time dll$iswait is true that OpenHoldem has been returned the correct result. When you go down this route you may encounter the problem of OpenHoldem stop evaluating the formulas, because there has been no change in state and dll$iswait is false. The best thing to do in this case is to disable all caching inside of OpenHoldem and always return a valid formula result and set dll$iswait to false on the very first valid frame with buttons you see from OpenHoldem. 
</blockquote>
<div class="Unindented">
In short: dll$iswait will be only needed if you do very time-consuming computations in your DLL that get executed in another thread. Just return true to tell OH: "Hey buddy, I am really busy atm. Please come back later and do something else in the meantime. Scrape some additional frames, sitin/sitout/rebuy etc." Most DLLs should just return false all the time.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<i>isfinalanswer</i>: an OH-symbol that becomes true, when all conditions are met that are required that the autoplayer acts (enough stable frames, dll$iswait = false, balance stability, etc.) If you want to execute your DLL-logic only once, you should wait for isfinal-answer = true and then calculate it on the fly. OH will be blocked for a small moment while your DLL is working.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-5"></a>cmd$recalc 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
A User DLL also has the ability to send the request "cmd$recalc", which will force OpenHoldem to recompute the versus tables and restart the Iterator thread.
