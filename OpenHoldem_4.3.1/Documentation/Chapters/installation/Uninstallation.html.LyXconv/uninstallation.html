<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >We hope you will never have to uninstall OpenHoldem on any of your machines.
However, we often see enthusiastic newbies who download OpenHoldem and naively
install it to their one and only machine without any attempts to stealth it. And
then they ask how they can get their computer clean again - be it that they
failed and want to play manually again or they want to create a clean setup for
production.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   Probably it is too late - you have already been flagged by your favourite casino.
Anyway - the &#8220;best&#8221; way to get your PC &#8220;clean&#8221; again without a reinstallation:
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">Remove the complete installation directory and all other botting-related
        files you may have on your computer: executables, formulae, tablemaps,
        archives, logs, etc.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Delete any desktop icons and delete any startmenu shortcut (if you have
        created them) .
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Take a registry-editor like regedit.exe and remove all registry-entries that
        indicate              the              use              of              OpenHoldem:
        HKEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE/OPENHOLDEM. And don&#8217;t
        forget the last recently used files; search for &#8220;openholdem&#8221;, &#8220;openscrape&#8221;,
        &#8220;manualmode&#8221;, &#8220;.ohf&#8221;, &#8220;.whf&#8221;, &#8220;.tm&#8221;, &#8220;maxinmontreal&#8221;  and maybe some
        others.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Wipe your browser cache.</li></ul>
