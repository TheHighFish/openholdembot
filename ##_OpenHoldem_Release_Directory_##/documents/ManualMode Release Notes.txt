v﻿12.0.3 2017-10-18
==================
MAINTENANCE:
- Turning DPI-awareness off for OpenHoldem, OpenScrape, OHReplay  and ManualMode. 
  DPI-awareness is a Windows-feature that makes applications believe
  that they run at a different screen-resolution as they actually do.
  This feature could affect connection to the tables (client-size).
  Thanks to WetOphelia for reporting and for the excellent explanations.
