v﻿12.0.3 2017-10-18
==================
MAINTENANCE:
- Turning DPI-awareness off for OpenHoldem, OpenScrape, OHReplay  and ManualMode. 
  DPI-awareness is a Windows-feature that makes applications believe
  that they run at a different screen-resolution as they actually do.
  This feature could affect connection to the tables (client-size).
  Thanks to WetOphelia for reporting and for the excellent explanations.

v11.0.1. 2017-01-14
===================
NEW STUFF:
- Supporting pure bitmaps now because too much beginners don't send complete frames.
  This way we can use at least the image info, but not the table-title in the HTML

v2.1.9.1 2011-06-08
===================
BUG FIXES: 
- OHR crashed if used with renamed replay-frames, 
  as it assumes a filename of the format "frame012345.htm".
  A runtime-check has been added to avoid the crash.
  Thanks to Buchas for reporting.
