This directory contains the OpenHoldem-manual and the OpenPPL-manual.
They are Windows help-files, that are compiled from HTML-files ("web-pages").
Some people can't view them because they originate from a different computer
and get blocked by Windows security settings, showing an error like
"Navigation to the website was cancelled".
If you experience this problem you can unblock the help-files:
  * right-click at the file
  * click Properties
  * click Unblock
  * click Apply
