//
// Changes
// =======
//   * removed postflop-logic that contained code-snippets from Zulu
//     (potential copyright-infringement) in favour of Gecko-logic.
//   * hand-categories turned from hand-expressions to hand-lists
//   * created extra categories for HU / ITM / bubble / early play.
//   * replaced user-variables like user_CutOff by OpenPPL
//     position-symbols like InCutOff.
//   * replaced version identifier by comment
//   * replaced user_Opponent_ALL_IN by OpponentIsAllin
//   * removed options for
//       * playing AA / KK multiway
//       * limping any two multiway
//       * playing bubble like 3-handed (AND vice versa)
//       * playing 3-handed like HeadsUp (AND vice versa)
//     in order to get reasonable AND simple strategy 
//   * replaced user-variable user_TheMoney by new OpenPPL-symbol InTheMoney
//   * replaced user-variable user_Bubble by new OpenPPL-symbol IsBubble
//   * removed superfluous variable user_true
//   * Replaced user_FullRing AND user_HeadsUp by
//     OpenPPL-symbols HandIsFullRing HandIsHeadsUp 
//   * removed variables userEarlyRaiser and user_BigBlind_We_Limped
//     which was only used in already removed postflop-play
//   * replaced user_MP / InEarlyPosition by InMiddlePosition / InEarlyPosition
//   * replaced user_RaiseQuad-logic by RaiseBy (4 * amountToCall) FORCE
//   * removed all casino-specific code in favour of automatic detection 
//     of blind-level and tournament stage.
//   * replaced user variables user_GameState_Early, ... by functions
//     f$EarlyStage, f$MiddleStage, f$LateStage
//   * replaced variable user_BLA_None by f4FirstAction
//   * Removed lots of now superfluous "InTheMoney"-variabled 
//     for stacksize-ranges of various players
//   * Replayed InTheMoney_BigStack, InTheMoney_MiddleStack 
//     and InTheMoney_SmallStack by user-defined functions
//   * Removed stacksize-variables for the bubble,
//     with one exception they were unused
//   * Simplified calculation if effectibe-stacksize-variables for headsup-play,
//     using EffectiveMaxStacksizeOfActiveOpponents
//   * Replaceed (InSmallBlind OR InBigBlind) by InTheBlinds
//   * Replaceed (InCutOff OR InButton) by InLatePosition
//   * Restructured the code, introducing extra-functions for
//     headsup, ITM, bubble and full-ring play
//   * Removed option to limp any two in SB in early stage
//   * Restructued the code, intriducing
//       f$Termita_SNG_Preflop_HeadsUp
//       f$Termita_SNG_Preflop_InTheMoney
//       f$Termita_SNG_Preflop_Bubble
//       f$Termita_SNG_Preflop_EarlyStage
//       f$Termita_SNG_Preflop_Fullring
//   * Added raise vs sit-outs
//   * Added Termita prefold
//   * Tidied HU removed unnecessary lines
//   * Replaced any remaning user variables with functions
//   * Removed possibility of a situation qualifying for more than one stage/section 
//   * Created OpponentSignificantAllin, using instead of OpponentIsAllin for some cases
//   * Created late stage and...
		  // Created late stage list based open push fold and added lists
		  // Created late stage list based re-push and squeeze and added lists
//   * In Early Stage
		  // Only playing Cat2 from BigBlind or SmallBlind I increased that a little 
		  // Added SmallBlind complete and new lists
		  // Added Call From BigBlind and new lists
	  // In early stage the current code will re-raise by 3BB if facing a raise or 3Bet
		  // As 3BB is too small for a 3Bet I increased it - considering this increase we wont
		  // want to fold too often so I made some changes
		  // these changes need review
//  * Avoiding 4Bet pots
		// We fold listCat3 and 4 when faced with a 3Bet after we open raise
		// But we 4Bet a 3Bet if an opponent open raises
		// If we avoid 4Bet pots we start it only makes sense to avoid
		// them if started by other players, also it is easier to fold
		// those as we have less invested
		// I stopped it raising 3Bet pots with less than Cat2 hands 
	
//   * In middle stage 
	// Only playing Cat2 from BigBlind increased that a little 
	// Increased 3Bet size
	// Added SmallBlind complete for SetMining PotShots etc, with new lists
	// Added call from BigBlind and new lists
	// Avoid 4Bet pots as in early stage 
//   *  In Bubble
	// Tidied code
	// Added some short-stack push fold, should I add re-push
	// Bubble play needs some thought, I have kept as close as possible to original
		// If we play against an allin we only call never push to try to
		// isolate and also avoid a re-raise after we call maybe we should
		// push some of these depending on stack/pot size
		// When no opponent is allin we always RaiseMax maybe we should
		// consider some standard raises if deep stacked?
		// we definitely need to consider this if the profile was to be used in
		// MTTs Freerolls or MTTSnG
//   * Most sections deal with OpponentIsAllin before normal play but sometimes the blocks
	// for this didn't close so OpponentIsAllin was also dealt with in normal play stopped that
	
//   * Extend some play against multiway or opponent allin for late and middle stages 

//   * Changed 'MaxStillToActStackSize < 100% StackSize' To 'Not f$We_Are_Covered' in bubble
	// It doesn't make any difference now but just to have a direct contradiction
	// in case of future changes or user changes
//   * Created 'TheBiggestActiveOpponentsStack' Unlike 'MaxStacksizeOfActiveOpponents' this
	// includes current bets - using it for full stack comparison instead of effective 
//   * user_Bubble_We_Are_Covered I couldn't see it defined in the Termita I downloaded
	// Created user symbol 'f$We_Are_Covered' and based it on 'TheBiggestActiveOpponentsStack'
	// Although I think originally this was based on 'MaxStillToActStackSize'
//   * 'AverageStackSize' is based on effective pot size so I created
	// 'TableAverageStackAtStartOfHand'
