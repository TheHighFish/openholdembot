PokerAcademy displays slightly different for every system. 
This tablemap is designed for 
  * Windows XP 
  * 32 bit colour-depth 
  * 1024x768 screen resolution
  * classic window theme
  * full-size PokerAcademy window
  * game-type no-limit 
This TM is based on an old map by Ares and works flawlessly for THF.
However it might need some tweaks, depending on your system settings.
