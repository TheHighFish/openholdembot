\begin_layout Chapter
Favourite Failures

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter will teach you about the most common beginners mistakes.
 They all have been reported at least several times; solving these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

problems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over and over again has cost hundreds of newbies (and especially the forum-regu
lars!) quite some time and nerves.
 But the good news is: these issues are easy to avoid once you are aware
 of them.
 And the even better news: writing this manual took some time (due to all
 these newbies ;-); in the mean-time we managed to prevent these beginner
 mistakes and to auto-detect most of the rest.
 There even is a new feature called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Problem Solver
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that will assist you a little bit up to the point where OpenHoldem is able
 to act.

OpenHoldem does not connect to the table
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Table not recognized because of incorrect system-settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recognize a table the following criteria have to match:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
size of the window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
table-title
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
optional tablepoints r$tablepointX if you have two very similar maps for
 the same casino, e.g.
 6-max and 9-max.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually the problem is the window-size caused by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 system-settings.
 Tablepoints are rarely used, but you should be aware of their existence,
 especially if you downloaded somebody elses map from the forum.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The autoplayer of all more recent versions (4.x+) will immediatelly be enabled
 after connection to a table, but it can only act if the scraper recognizes
 your cards and at least two buttons.

OpenHoldem calls any hand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Tablemap does not detect bet amounts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If OpenHoldem calls every hand --- except maybe the strong ones --- this
 is probably neither a bug in OpenHoldem nor bad logic in the bot, but a
 problem with the Tablemap or with your settings again: The TM does most
 probably not recognize your opponents bet, so OpenHoldem thinks you have
 a free play and calls.

\begin_layout Standard
To work properly OpenHoldem must have recognized the userchair.
 Also some symbols are only valid when it is your turn to act.
 So you should highlight some buttons in ManualMode; just click them; usually
 they are grey, which means not existent.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes new users complain that OpenHoldem executes the wrong action.
 The most common reason -- after bad bot-logic -- are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

missing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 buttons that did not get recognized by the tablemap.
 In the example above no raise-button could not be found that at many casinos
 gets used to confirm the betsize.
 As a consequence OpenHoldem chose a so-called backup-action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
OpenHoldem acts multiple times
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Improper bring-delay and scraper-delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bring-delay should be somewhat smaller than the scraper-delay.
 Otherwise it can happen that OpenHoldem acts but bring doesn't display
 a new image in time.
 So when the next heart-beat-cycle starts, OpenHoldem will scrape the exact
 same game-state another time and act another time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
This problem has been improved by marking frames as unstable when OpenHoldem
 acts, so OpenHoldem has to wait for a certain number of stable frames again.
 However the problem may still appear, if your scraper- and bring-delay
 do mismatch or if you don't wait for stable frames.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
OpenHoldem permanently clicks sitout / sitin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Tablemap does not correctly scrape sitin/sitout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tablemap probably does not correctly determine the state of the sitin-
 or sitout-region; as a consequence the bot will think its action had no
 effect and will try over and over again.
 There is a funny legend back from the ancient times of WinHoldem or OPI:
 the tablemap (a built-in feature of the software at that time) once again
 failed because of a casino-update.
 As a consequence lots of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

players
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were suddenly sitting in and sitting out once per second.
 It must have been a devilish joy for their opponents; innummerable bots
 got reported and finally busted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So always remember: Bots are very stupid and very volatile beings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
This can no longer happen as we execute the hopper functions only once every
 4 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
OpenScrape does recognize something, but OpenHoldem does not (I)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Different versions of the same map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very common 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bug
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-report: some beginner has just fixed his first map and complains that OpenScrap
e recognizes the bets, the fonts of the player names or whatever; but OpenHoldem
 fails to do so.
 The reason is quite simple: he usually has multiple versions of the map
 in his scraper-folder and has simply loaded the wrong map.
 If you have the auto-connector enabled, OpenHoldem will load the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 map that fits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
This gets now prevented as OpenHoldem checks if multiple maps with the same
 sitename exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
OpenScrape does recognize something, but OpenHoldem does not (II)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Halfmade tablemap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scraping is the most time-consuming part of the heartbeat-cycle, so OpenHoldem
 does implement some reasonable optimizations.
 It will only scrape names, bets and balances of a certain chair, if that
 chair is occupied.
 If OpenScrape and your tablemap are able to scrape those regions but OpenHoldem
 does not do so, then you have most probably forgotten to define pXseated
 or uXseated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
This gets now prevented, as OpenHoldem checks for complete tablemnaps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
OpenHoldem works locally, but not remotely with bring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Different system configurations on your casino-machine and your
 bot-machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a quite common beginners mistake to setup the casino-machine in a
 different way than the bot-machine.
 The casino-client will be rendered in a different way, so OpenHoldem will
 no longer be able to scrape the screenshots displayed by Bring.
 If you don't want to install OpenHoldem on the casino-machine to check
 the settings, the only way to fix that problem is a careful manual walk-through
 (experts could clone a VM or deploy some registry-settings).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
OpenHoldem does not load my DLL (I).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Missing or incorrect libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most DLLs use external functionality and therefore depend on supporting
 libraries.
 Most often this is msvcrt (MicroSoft Visual Studio C++ RunTime Library).
 Also the correct version is important.
 OpenHoldem requires currently Visual Studio 2010 Professional, but Perl
 needs 2005.
 Checking the dependencies of your DLL with MicroSoft Dependency Walker
 will help.

OpenHoldem checked, but didfold is true
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: TM does not recognize buttons correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you get a freeplay, it might be that your check-button (or a check/fold-butto
n!) is at the same location where usually the fold-button is located.
 If you have a simple way to detect buttons (e.g.
 by colour) you probably will recognize that button as fold.
 So OpenHoldem --- not seeing a check-button --- will check by clicking
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and didfold will be true.
 Similar things can happen if buttons move, e.g.
 a call-button at the raise-position when you can only fold or call allin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
History symbols do not work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: Incorrect hand-reset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some symbols only require the current gamestate to be calculated (e.g.
 dealerchair, balance, nbetstocall).
 Others (like didcallround1, nbetsround3 etc.) require a complete game-history
 and will reset at the beginning of a new hand.
 If they all are zero (or -1), you have probably caused an incorrect hand-reset,
 e.g.
 by temporary occlusion.
 You should avoid occlusion by any means.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
This problem has now practically disappeared, since OpenHoldem supports
 ten different handreset-methods, but only accepts a hand-reset if multiple
 methods fire at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
When the blinds increase OpenHoldem keeps the old values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reason: tournament not recognized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detecting the blind values correctly is extremely important, as it affects
 all kinds of other symbols.
 Therefore OpenHoldem provides the ability to automatically lock the blinds
 as soon as they are known and reasonable.
 For the current hand and (for cashgames) for the rest of the session (after
 several hands have been played).
 As a consequence OpenHoldem needs to know if the current table belongs
 to a tournament and the blinds may go up.
 In the past there has been a tablemap-symbol r$istournament, but way too
 much beginners (and veterans too!) mixed it up, so OpenHoldem detects tournamen
ts now automatically based on several different factors;

\begin_layout Itemize
scraped MTT_symbols like players_remaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However in some very rare cases it might be that all methods of recognizing
 a tournament fail.
 Some casino tables don't display helpful titles or have no titles at all.
 The tablemap might not provide support for optional tournament information
 and even the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beautiful sum of chips
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might not fit if you connect in the middle of an MTT.
 The methods of detecting tournaments still get fine-tuned, so if you experience
 this problem please get in contact with us.

This code basically says: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do prefold, if is is preflop and I don't have a very great hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 However you only get stable frames when it is your turn.
 So it might be that you get a mis-scrape, e.g.
 occlusion by a rebuy-window.
 Or the poker-room might update its display, temporarily showing only one
 of your wonderful aces.
 So OpenHoldem can't recognize your great hand and folds.
 To avoid that problem, you need more fail-safe coding and explicitly specify
 the hands to fold: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do prefold, if it is preflop and I have a trash-hand.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
This way mis-scrapes will not be able to defeat your fine strategy.
 Instead a mis-scrape will only keep f$prefold false and delay the folding
 of trash.
 The same problem might occur in all functions that might act on unstable
 frames (when it is not your turn), especially f$prefold, f$sitin, f$sitout,
 f$leave, f$rebuy and f$chat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark*
This failure gets now prevented too, as OpenHoldem will will execute f$prefold
 only if both cards are known.
 However: as you can see lots of things could go wrong if you are careless.
 Therefore it is always a good idea to keep these potential pitfalls in
 mind and prefer a conservative style of coding your bot.

\begin_layout Standard
Some people have the problem that OpenHoldem 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

does not act
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 despite the log clearly shows the opposite:

2016-03-26 00:23:05 -   Best action:   f$betsize = 30.00

\begin_layout Plain Layout

2016-03-26 00:23:05 -   Action taken:  f$betsize
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason: OpenHoldem did act, but the casino did not react.
 As it turned out this problem was caused by Windows user account control
 (UAC), that prevents the generation of virtual keyboard events.
 OpenHoldem (or Bring) simply missed the necessary right to generate mouse-click
s and keyboard-events.
 To fix this just modify the permissions like below.
