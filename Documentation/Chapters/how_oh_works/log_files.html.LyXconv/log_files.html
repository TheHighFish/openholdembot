Sometimes the bot might take an unexpected decision, more rarely for bots in production, but for sure regularly for bots in development. The reason can be mis-scrapes (Table Map or improper system settings); it can be bad bot-logic; it can even be a bug in OpenHoldem.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Many newbies will automatically assume the latter case. Whenever you encounter a strange behaviour it is a good decision to make use of OpenHoldems logging capabilities. OpenHoldem will generate a log file as it operates, less detailed logs for production, more detailed logs for debugging. The verbosity of the log can be set in the Preferences tabs <i>Logging</i> and <i>Debugging</i>. The log file can be found at <i>OpenHoldem\logs\oh_NN.log</i> where NN is the session-ID.

On every autoplayer action OpenHolldem will create a section with some basic info about the table-state, the decision taken and the action executed.

<h3 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--2"></a>Autoplayer Trace
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If you want to go into detail the most useful part of the log is clearly the autoplayer-trace. It helps you to investigateö the entire evaluation that caused a decision. Let’s assume we have a f$allin-function that looks like that: <div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$allin##
   f$HaveUnbeatableMonster
OR f$HaveSuperDuperDraw
OR f$PoorHeroIsPotCommitted
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
On evaluation of f$allin OpenHoldem will look up the three user-defined functions (f$HaveUnbeatableMonster, ...), evaluate them and combine their return-values to a final result. This leads to a simplified call-tree:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="float">
<div class="figure">
<img class="embedded" src="images/log_simple_call_tree.png" alt="figure images/log_simple_call_tree.png" style="max-width: 517px; max-height: 103px;"/>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Each function that is one level indented got called by the next function above that is one level less indented. Things would be easy (or a night-mare) if all code was in one oversized function and all called symbols were black boxes. However one of the advantages of OH-script and OpenPPL is that you can structure your code and create functions on your own. Indeed OpenPPL provides several hundred poker-logical functions that work out of the box. They are all available as plain text, so that you can have a look at their code and OpenHoldem can log their evaluation in detail. Let’s assume your user-defined function f$HaveUnbeatableMonster is an easy one and just considers the winning percentage (the built-in symbol prwin), f$HaveSuperDuperDraw uses the OpenPPL-symbols HaveStraightDraw and HaveFlushDraw, whereas f$PoorHeroIsPotCommitted uses Balance and Pot. Then the autoplayer-trace could look like this:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="float">
<div class="figure">
<img class="embedded" src="images/log_detailed_call_tree.png" alt="figure images/log_detailed_call_tree.png" style="max-width: 514px; max-height: 215px;"/>

</div>

</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
So the implementation and the evaluation of each symbol use some other symbols that are one level deeper indented in the autoplayer-trace. In practice the autoplayer-trace will get even more detailed. For example even a simple symbol like Balance might need the user-chair, the size of the big-blind and some more. But the principle is always the same and with a little bit experience the logs become easy to read.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--3"></a>OpenPPL

<div class="Unindented">
OpenPPL works very similar to OH-script. Basic info and the autoplayer-trace are the same.

<h4 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--1"></a>Initializations
</h4>
<div class="Unindented">
Most OpenPPL-symbols get calculated on the fly when you need them. But some symbols require special initialization, exactly once per orbit when it is our turn and the scraper saw enough stable frames. This is the case mainly for counters like &ldquo;Raises&rdquo;, &ldquo;Calls&rdquo; and some more.<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">InitMemorySymbols = 0.000 [Line 18/3976]
  TimeToInitMemorySymbols = 1.000 [Line 8/3921]

...
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
You will see these initializations on top of the autoplayer-trace, i.e. below the summary, but above f$preflop.

<h4 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--2"></a>Main evaluations

<div class="Unindented">
After everything got initialized OpenHoldem will evaluate the main OpenPPL-function for the current betround: f$preflop, f$flop, f$turn or f$river. <div class="listing">

The evaluator-engine needs to handle three different type of final actions:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
betsizes (in big-blinds), encoded as positive numbers, so f$preflop = 11.000 in the example above means RaiseTo 11 (big blinds).
</li>
<li>
percentaged potsized bets, encoded as small negative numbers. -0.666 means bet 2/3 pot.
</li>
<li>
fixed actions, encoded as large negative numbers.<div class="listing">

</div>
Altogether 25 named action-constants — too many to mention them here. But they are in the OpenPPL-library which is a plain-text-file. Feel welcome to have a look — there are many interesting things to discover.
</li>

</ul>
<h4 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-1"></a>Undefined Actions and Return Values
</h4>
<div class="Unindented">
Whenever OpenHoldem reaches the end of a function it will evaluate a special symbol &ldquo;empty_expression__false__zero__when_others_fold_force&rdquo;. So it will no longer continue silently with an &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; value like in the past. Instead it will create a verbose log-file. This symbol always evaluates to zero, which is also the encoding of &ldquo;False&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fold&rdquo;.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">f$flop = 0.000 [Line 27/73]
   ...
   empty_expression__false__zero__when_others_fold_force = 0.000
f$check = 1.000 [cached] 
f$fold = 1.000 [cached]
</pre>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
So whenever you see this symbol in your log-files you know that your profile does not handle the current situation. This regularly happens for so-called &ldquo;tweaks&rdquo;, i.e. incomplete profiles, meant to be used on top of another one. Folding a set of kings? No wonder, nothing to be tweaked, playing sets of kings is easy. In such cases you have to complete your profile. Tweaking, completing and combining profiles is explained in the OpenPPL-manual.
</div>
<h4 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--4"></a>Autoplayer Actions
</h4>
<div class="Unindented">
After the OpenPPL-decision gets calculated OpenHoldem translates it to OH-script autoplayer-actions (plural because of backup-actions) and thereafter the autoplayer works the normal way. That’s why you can see some OH-script autoplayer-functions at the end of the autoplayer-trace, each one with a pre-computed (&ldquo;<i>[cached]</i>&rdquo;) value. Please be aware that OpenHoldem — contrary to OpenPPL — doesn’t use big-blinds for its calculations but dollars. So &ldquo;RaiseTo 11&rdquo; in the example above leads to a f$betsize of $880.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">f$betsize = 880.000 [cached] 
f$raise = 1.000 [cached] 
f$call = 1.000 [cached] 
f$check = 1.000 [cached]
f$allin_on_betsize_balance_ratio = 0.000 [Line 5/1864]
f$fold = 1.000 [cached]

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--4"></a>Errors and Warnings

<div class="Unindented">
Besides of the autoplayer-trace OpenHoldem logs all errors and warnings, i.e.:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
all shown error-messages
</li>
<li>
all message-boxes that got suppressed by your preferences

Debug messages are mainly meant for developers and for experienced users who want to get more info about the way how OpenHoldem works internally. These messages can be turned on with the Debugging-tab of the Preferences dialog. They are very useful for finding and fixing bugs, but they are usually not needed for most end-users. Below an example about blind-detection, blind-locking (for stability) and detecting hand-resets.

However it is possible to enable DLL-logging, then OpenHoldem will continue like in the axample above if the DLL-function calls back to OH-script. Furthermore it is possible to log any user-defined messages from the DLL to the standard OpenHoldem-log with a function from the DLL-interface:
