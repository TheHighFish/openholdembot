</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
ManualMode is a tool for simulating a poker game state offine. It allows you to set any game state you can think of, including your cards, buttons, etc. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A Table Map is included with the ManualMode tool to allow OpenHoldem to connect to the ManualMode main window and scrape the game state 100% correctly into the OpenHoldem engine. This will allow for offline construction of bot logic and the easy setup of various game state situations, some of which are very rare online (think Straight Flushes).

There are some shortcuts built into ManualMode to allow easier setup of from the table. As players are added, they will Sit Down, Sit In, and will be assigned a name and balance. Players will be added from chair 0 to chair 9, depending on what is open, and removed in reverse order. for a string to be entered.
