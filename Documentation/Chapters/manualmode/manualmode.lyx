Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ManualMode is a tool for simulating a poker game state offine.
 It allows you to set any game state you can think of, including your cards,
 buttons, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Table Map is included with the ManualMode tool to allow OpenHoldem to
 connect to the ManualMode main window and scrape the game state 100% correctly
 into the OpenHoldem engine.
 This will allow for offline construction of bot logic and the easy setup
 of various game state situations, some of which are very rare online (think
 Straight Flushes).

\begin_layout Standard
The ManualMode interface is quite intuitive.
 All relevant elements on the poker table are visible at all times, either
 populated with objects (like cards or bets), or outlined in white dashed
 lines if not populated.
 Each game state element is interacted with slightly differently and is
 discussed below.
 In general, however, right-clicking on any element will bring up a list

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Player Names: Right-clicking on the player’s name rectangle will pop up
 a window prompting for a string to use as the player’s name.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Player Balances: Right-clicking on the player’s balance rectangle will pop
 up a window prompting for a string to use as the player’s balance.
 Note: prior to assigning balances, a player must have “Sat Down” at the

 around the table anti-clockwise or clockwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Blinds/Limits: Right-clicking on the center information box will pop up
 a window in which the small blind, big blind, big bet, ante, game type
 (FL, PL, NL), network (useful if integrating with {PokerTracker}), and
 tournament indicator can be set.
 Buttons: Left-clicking on any game-state button on the table will toggle
 its state from on to off.
 These include the FCKRA buttons on the bottom right (fold, call, check,
 table, prefold, autopost).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some shortcuts built into ManualMode to allow easier setup of
 from the table.
 As players are added, they will Sit Down, Sit In, and will be assigned
 a name and balance.
 Players will be added from chair 0 to chair 9, depending on what is open,
 and removed in reverse order.

 The format of the macro string is described here at the bottom of this
 page.
 Betting: Left-clicking (right click to set a specific bet amount).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: When ManualMode detects a betting round change (i.e.
 0 to 3, 3 to 4 or 4 to 5 common cards), then all player bets will be collected
 into the pot, and all player bets will be reset to zero.
