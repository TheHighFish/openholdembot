</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Creating a bot that wins (or buying a bot that makes the botter whine) is one thing. Putting it to the tables regularly to make some volume is another task that can be time-consuming and boring. Of course this one can be automated too, but only some tasks of the job are directly supported by OpenHoldem. OpenHoldem is mainly designed as a single-tabling poker-playing application. It is not designed for handling multiple windows (lobby, registration popups), scheduling sessions or interpreting non-numerical input. In this chapter we will consider the tasks that usually need to be done by a hopper.

<li>
Arrange the poker-tables in a non-obstructive way so that every table can be scraped properly

<li>
Close popups (true windows with the popup-blocker, painted casino-advertisements that look similar to windows with the i86-spam-buttons)

<li>
Tick &ldquo;wait for big-blind&rdquo; in cash-games
</li>
<li>
Tick &ldquo;auto-post blind&rdquo;

</li>
<li>
Execute a custom rebuy-script if f$rebuy returns a positive number (rebuy-amount in dollars)
</li>
<li>
Click the [x] in the title-bar to close the poker-table if f$close is true
</li>
<li>
Disconnect if the table disappears and be ready for the next table

Shutdown OpenHoldem, using the f$terminate-function (since OpenHoldem 8.0.1)

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--5"></a>Architectural conclusions
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
As you can see a hopper can be devided into four functional parts
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Starting and configuring software
</li>
<li>
Closing software
</li>
<li>
Starting new tables, the main hopper loop
</li>
<li>
Managing a connected table (singular!)
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
The first two jobs are more or less trivial. Opening new tables in the main hopper loop is the main part of a hopper that canâ€™t be done by OpenHoldem (designed as: single bot, single table, single window). So all you truely need nowadays is a <i>table-opener </i>(fire and forget). There are cheap and good table-openers available for the main casinos that get used by flesh-and-blood poker-players. Only for smaller pokersites you have to create such a thing on your own. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
All the remaining tasks (posting blinds, rebuys, closing the table) can be done with OpenHoldems built-in hopper functionality that got added over time. This is not too difficult and only requires the configuration of a handful hopper-functions like f$sitout and f$close, plus some casino-specific tablemap-regions (sitout button) to make it work everywhere. Finally a small example to demonstrate the simplicity of OpenHoldems hopper-functions:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$close##
  WHEN (issittingout
    AND handsplayed &gt; 0
    AND elapsedauto &gt; 120)  // No autoplayer action since 2 minutes
  RETURN TRUE FORCE
</pre>
</div>
.
