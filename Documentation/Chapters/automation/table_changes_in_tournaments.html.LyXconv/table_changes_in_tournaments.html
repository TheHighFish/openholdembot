</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
If you play multi-table-tournaments then you will be regularly moved to new tables when your opponents drop out and the table becomes too short-handed. From a technical point of view there are six cases how these table-changes can happen:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
The casino keeps the current window open, keeps the user in his current seat, only the opponents change. This case is completely non-critical and OpenHoldem will keep on playing.
</li>
<li>
The casino keeps the current window open, but moves the user to a different seat. This case is not really critical either. As soon as OpenHoldem sees cards in a non-showdown-situation it will recognize the user-chair and then lock the new value for stability reasons.
</li>
<li>
The casino closes the old table and opens a new one. No problem: OpenHoldem will disconnect and the auto-connector will connect to the new table as if it was a new session. Then OpenHoldem will continue playing like before.
</li>
<li>
The casino doesn’t close the old table, but opens a new one. No problem: the built-in auto-starter (since version 11.1.0) will take care that at least one free instance is always running and waiting for new tables.
</li>
<li>
The casino opens a new table with a different table-theme, e.g. the final table at FullTilt Poker. Not much problem either. You probably need a second tablemap for the new table-theme. If the table-size and the table-title are identical then your tablemap needs some tablepoints so that the auto-connector can select the correct map. But that’s it.
</li>
<li>
The casino keeps the old-table, but changes the table-theme. Don’t worry. OpenHoldem will check the tablepoints regularly and if they do no longer match for a certain time then OpenHoldem will disconnect from the table and connect again, this time with the correct tablemap. And then OpenHoldem will continue playing like before.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Long story short: changing table-themes need a little bit support by your tablemap, but otherwise OpenHoldem handles all table-changes the automagical way.
