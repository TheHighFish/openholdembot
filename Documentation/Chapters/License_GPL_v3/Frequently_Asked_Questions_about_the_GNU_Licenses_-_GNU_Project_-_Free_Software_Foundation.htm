    interfaces that are non-visual in nature. How can I comply with the

    binaries via physical media without accompanying sources.  Can I
    provide source code by FTP instead of by mail order?</a></li>

    enough to distribute the source for the original version?</a></li>
  
    <li><a href="#DistributingSourceIsInconvenient">I want to distribute

    GPL require me to provide source code that can be built to match
    the exact hash of the binary I am distributing?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#ReleaseNotOriginal">Can I release a program with a
    license which says that you can distribute modified versions of it
    under the GPL but you can't distribute the original itself under the
    GPL?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#CompanyGPLCostsMoney">I just found out that a company
    has a copy of a GPL'ed program, and it costs money to get it.
    Aren't they violating the GPL by not making it available on the
    Internet?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#UnreleasedMods">A company is running a modified
    version of a GPL'ed program on a web site.  Does the GPL say they
    must release their modified sources?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#InternalDistribution">Is use within one organization
    or company “distribution”?</a></li>

    majority-owned, and controlled, subsidiary constitute
    distribution?</a></li>
    
    <li><a href="#ClickThrough">Can software installers ask people to
    click to agree to the GPL?  If I get some software under the GPL, do
    I have to agree to anything?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#GPLCompatInstaller">I would like to bundle GPLed
    software with some sort of installation software.  Does that
    installer need to have a GPL-compatible license?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#ExportWarranties">Does a distributor violate the GPL
    if they require me to “represent and warrant” that I
    am located in the US, or that I intend to distribute the software
    in compliance with relevant export control laws?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#v3Under4and5">The beginning of GPLv3 section 6 says
    that I can convey a covered work in object code form “under
    the terms of sections 4 and 5” provided I also meet the
    conditions of section 6. What does that mean?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#v2OrLaterPatentLicense">My company owns a lot of
    patents. Over the years we've contributed code to projects under
    “GPL version 2 or any later version”, and the project
    itself has been distributed under the same terms. If a user decides
    to take the project's code (incorporating my contributions) under
    GPLv3, does that mean I've automatically granted GPLv3's explicit
    patent license to that user?</a></li>

    <li><a href="#v3ConditionalWarranty">If I distribute a GPLv3-covered
    program, can I provide a warranty that is voided if the user
    modifies the program?</a></li>

<dd><p>
Using the GNU GPL will require that all
the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html">released improved versions be free
software</a>.  This means you can avoid the risk of having to compete with
a proprietary modified version of your own work.  However, in some special

Anyone can release a program under the GNU GPL, but that does not

<p>Making the program a GNU software package means explicitly contributing

<dd><p>
A crucial aspect of free software is that users are free to cooperate.
It is absolutely essential to permit users who wish to help each other
to share their bug fixes and improvements with other users.</p>

<p>Some have proposed alternatives to the GPL that require modified
versions to go through the original author.  As long as the original
author keeps up with the need for maintenance, this may work well in
practice, but if the author stops (more or less) to do something else
or does not attend to all the users' needs, this scheme falls down.
Aside from the practical problems, this scheme does not allow users to
help each other.</p>

<p>Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of
preventing confusion between various versions made by users.  In our
experience, this confusion is not a major problem.  Many versions of
Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project, but users can tell them
apart.  The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her
name on it, to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the
reputations of other maintainers.</p></dd>


<dt id="GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">Does the GPL require that
    source code of modified versions be posted to the public?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
The GPL does not require you to release your modified version, or any
part of it.  You are free to make modifications and use them privately,
without ever releasing them.  This applies to organizations (including
companies), too; an organization can make a modified version and use it
internally without ever releasing it outside the organization.</p>

<p>But <em>if</em> you release the modified version to the public in some
way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the
program's users, under the GPL.</p>

<p>Thus, the GPL gives permission to release the modified program in
certain ways, and not in other ways; but the decision of whether to release
it is up to you.</p></dd>

No.  The GPL gives him permission to make and redistribute copies of

right not to redistribute the program, when that is what he
chooses.</p></dd>


<dt id="WhatDoesWrittenOfferValid">What does “written offer

<dd><p>
If you choose to provide source through a written offer, then anybody
who requests the source from you is entitled to receive it.</p>

<p>If you commercially distribute binaries not accompanied with source
code, the GPL says you must provide a written offer to distribute the
source code later.  When users non-commercially redistribute the
binaries they received from you, they must pass along a copy of this
written offer.  This means that people who did not get the binaries
directly from you can still receive copies of the source code, along with
the written offer.</p>

<p>The reason we require the offer to be valid for any third party
is so that people who receive the binaries indirectly in that way
can order the source code from you.</p></dd>


<dt id="TheGPLSaysModifiedVersions">GPLv2 says that modified

<dd><p>
Section 2 says that modified versions you distribute must be
licensed to all third parties under the GPL.  “All third

You are not required to claim a copyright on your changes.  In most
countries, however, that happens automatically by default, so you need to
place your changes explicitly in the public domain if you do not want them
to be copyrighted.</p>

<p>Whether you claim a copyright on your changes or not, either way you

Yes, the GPL allows everyone to do this.  The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html">right to sell copies</a> is part of the
definition of free software.  Except in one special situation, there is
no limit on what price you can charge.  (The one exception is the

<dt id="DoesTheGPLAllowDownloadFee">Does the GPL allow me to charge a

<dd><p>
Yes.  You can charge any fee you wish for distributing a copy of the
program.  If you distribute binaries by download, you must provide
“equivalent access” to download the source—therefore, the
fee to download source may not be greater than the fee to download the
binary.</p></dd>

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#DoesTheGPLAllowRequireFee">#DoesTheGPLAllowRequireFee</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  In fact, a requirement like that would make the program non-free.
If people have to pay when they get a copy of a program, or if they
have to notify anyone in particular, then the program is not free.
See the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">
definition of free software</a>.</p>

<p>The GPL is a free software license, and therefore it permits people
to use and even redistribute the software without being required to
pay anyone a fee for doing so.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> charge people a fee

No.  The GPL says that anyone who receives a copy from you has the

<dd><p>
Yes.  For instance, you can accept a contract to develop changes and
agree not to release <em>your changes</em> until the client says ok.
This is permitted because in this case no GPL-covered code is
being distributed under an NDA.</p>

<p>You can also release your changes to the client under the GPL, but
agree not to release them to anyone else unless the client says ok.  In
this case, too, no GPL-covered code is being distributed under an NDA,

<p>The GPL would give the client the right to redistribute your version.
In this scenario, the client will probably choose not to exercise that right,

You can certainly get credit for the work.  Part of releasing a

<dd><p> No, this is not permitted under the terms of the GPL. While we
recognize that proper citation is an important part academic
publication, citation cannot be added as an additional requirement to

requirement under section 7(b) of GPLv3, and therefore would be
considered an additional restriction under Section 7 of the GPL. And

Including a copy of the license with the work is vital so that

<p>It might be tempting to include a URL that refers to the license,
instead of the license itself.  But you cannot be sure that the URL
will still be valid, five years or ten years from now.  Twenty years
from now, URLs as we know them today may no longer exist.</p>

<p>The only way to make sure that people who have copies of the program
will continue to be able to see the license, despite all the changes

all doubt.</p>

<p>A file containing just a license, without a statement that certain

just a subroutine which is never called from anywhere else.  The
resemblance is not perfect: lawyers and courts might apply common

what the file's license is.  It may appear to have some other license,

<p>The preamble and instructions add up to some 1000 words, less

<p>For some licenses, the way in which the combination is made may affect
whether they are compatible—for instance, they may allow linking two

If you do this, your program won't be fully usable in a free
environment. If your program depends on a non-free library to do a
certain job, it cannot do that job in the Free World. If it depends on a
non-free library to run at all, it cannot be part of a free operating
system such as GNU; it is entirely off limits to the Free World.</p>

<p>So please consider: can you find a way to get the job done without using
this library? Can you write a free replacement for that library?</p>

<p>If the program is already written using the non-free library, perhaps it
is too late to change the decision. You may as well release the program
as it stands, rather than not release it. But please mention in the
README that the need for the non-free library is a drawback, and suggest
the task of changing the program so that it does the same job without
the non-free library.  Please suggest that anyone who thinks of doing
substantial further work on the program first free it from dependence
on the non-free library.</p>

Both versions of the GPL have an exception to their copyleft, commonly
called the system library exception.  If the GPL-incompatible libraries
you want to use meet the criteria for a system library, then you don't
have to do anything special to use them; the requirement to distribute
source code for the whole program does not include those libraries, even
if you distribute a linked executable containing them.</p>

<p>The criteria for what counts as a "system library" vary
between different versions of the GPL.  GPLv3 explicitly defines
"System Libraries" in section 1, to exclude it from the
definition of "Corresponding Source." GPLv2 deals with this
issue slightly differently, near the end of section 3.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="GPLIncompatibleLibs">What legal issues
    come up if I use GPL-incompatible libraries with GPL software?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GPLIncompatibleLibs">#GPLIncompatibleLibs</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>If you want your program to link against a library not covered by the
system library exception, you need to provide permission to do that.
Below are two example license notices that you can use to do that; one
for GPLv3, and the other for GPLv2.  In either case, you should put this
text in each file to which you are granting this permission.</p>

<p>Only the copyright holders for the program can legally release their
software under these terms. If you wrote the whole program yourself, then
assuming your employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are
the copyright holder—so you can authorize the exception. But if you want
to use parts of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your code,
you cannot authorize the exception for them. You have to get the approval
of the copyright holders of those programs.</p>

<p>When other people modify the program, they do not have to make the same
exception for their code—it is their choice whether to do so.</p>

<p>If the libraries you intend to link with are non-free, please also see
<a href="#FSWithNFLibs">the section on writing Free Software which uses
non-free libraries</a>.</p>

<p>If you're using GPLv3, you can accomplish this goal by granting an
additional permission under section 7.  The following license notice will
do that.  You must replace all the text in brackets with text that is
appropriate for your program.  If not everybody can distribute source for
the libraries you intend to link with, you should remove the text in
braces; otherwise, just remove the braces themselves.</p>

<dt id="HowIGetCopyright">How do I get a copyright on my program
    in order to release it under the GPL?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#HowIGetCopyright">#HowIGetCopyright</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Under the Berne Convention, everything written is automatically
copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form.  So you don't have to do
anything to “get” the copyright on what you write—as long
as nobody else can claim to own your work.</p>

<p>However, registering the copyright in the US is a very good idea.  It
will give you more clout in dealing with an infringer in the US.</p>

<p>The case when someone else might possibly claim the copyright is if
you are an employee or student; then the employer or the school might
claim you did the job for them and that the copyright belongs to them.
Whether they would have a valid claim would depend on circumstances
such as the laws of the place where you live, and on your employment
contract and what sort of work you do.  It is best to consult a lawyer
if there is any possible doubt.</p>

<p>If you think that the employer or school might have a claim, you can
resolve the problem clearly by getting a copyright disclaimer signed
by a suitably authorized officer of the company or school.  (Your
immediate boss or a professor is usually NOT authorized to sign such a
disclaimer.)</p></dd>

    might want to make my program into its own proprietary software product?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#WhatIfSchool">#WhatIfSchool</a>)</span></dt>

Many universities nowadays try to raise funds by restricting the use
of the knowledge and information they develop, in effect behaving little
different from commercial businesses.  (See “The Kept
University”, Atlantic Monthly, March 2000, for a general discussion
of this problem and its effects.)</p>

<p>If you see any chance that your school might refuse to allow your
program to be released as free software, it is best to raise the issue
at the earliest possible stage.  The closer the program is to working
usefully, the more temptation the administration might feel to take it
from you and finish it without you.  At an earlier stage, you have
more leverage.</p>

<p>So we recommend that you approach them when the program is only
half-done, saying, “If you will agree to releasing this as free
software, I will finish it.”  Don't think of this as a bluff.  To
prevail, you must have the courage to say, “My program will have
liberty, or never be born.”</p></dd>

Strictly speaking, the GPL is a license from the developer for others

<dd><p>
Yes, because the copyright on the editors and tools does not cover
the code you write.  Using them does not place any restrictions, legally,
on the license you use for your code.</p>

<p>Some programs copy parts of themselves into the output for technical
reasons—for example, Bison copies a standard parser program into its
output file.  In such cases, the copied text in the output is covered
by the same license that covers it in the source code.  Meanwhile, the
part of the output which is derived from the program's input inherits
the copyright status of the input.</p>

<p>As it happens, Bison can also be used to develop non-free programs.
This is because we decided to explicitly permit the use of the Bison
standard parser program in Bison output files without restriction.  We
made the decision because there were other tools comparable to Bison
which already permitted use for non-free programs.</p></dd>

<dd><p>
In general this is legally impossible; copyright law does not give you
any say in the use of the output people make from their data using
your program.  If the user uses your program to enter or convert his
own data, the copyright on the output belongs to him, not you.  More
generally, when a program translates its input into some other form,
the copyright status of the output inherits that of the input it was
generated from.</p>

<p>So the only way you have a say in the use of the output is if
substantial parts of the output are copied (more or less) from text in
your program.  For instance, part of the output of Bison (see above)
would be covered by the GNU GPL, if we had not made an exception in
this specific case.</p>

<p>You could artificially make a program copy certain text into its
output even if there is no technical reason to do so.  But if that

The GPL says that the whole combined program has to be released

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#IfInterpreterIsGPL">#IfInterpreterIsGPL</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is no.  The
interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; a free software
license like the GPL, based on copyright law, cannot limit what data you
use the interpreter on.  You can run it on any data (interpreted program),
any way you like, and there are no requirements about licensing that data
to anyone.</p>

<p>However, when the interpreter is extended to provide
“bindings” to other facilities (often, but not necessarily,
libraries), the interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities
it uses through these bindings. So if these facilities are released under
the GPL, the interpreted program that uses them must be released in a
GPL-compatible way.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an example of such
a binding mechanism; libraries that are accessed in this way are linked
dynamically with the Java programs that call them.  These libraries are
also linked with the interpreter.  If the interpreter is linked statically
with these libraries, or if it is designed to
<a href="#GPLPluginsInNF">link dynamically with these specific
libraries</a>, then it too needs to be released in a GPL-compatible
way.</p>

<p>Another similar and very common case is to provide libraries with the
interpreter which are themselves interpreted.  For instance, Perl
comes with many Perl modules, and a Java implementation comes with
many Java classes.  These libraries and the programs that call them
are always dynamically linked together.</p>

<p>A consequence is that if you choose to use GPL'd Perl modules or Java
classes in your program, you must release the program in a
GPL-compatible way, regardless of the license used in the Perl or Java
interpreter that the combined Perl or Java program will run on.

exception in section 3.</p>

<p>You may not distribute these libraries in compiled DLL form with
the program. To prevent unscrupulous distributors from trying to use
the System Library exception as a loophole, the GPL says that
libraries can only qualify as System Libraries as long as they're not

the program, they won't be eligible for this exception anymore; then
the only way to comply with the GPL would be to provide their source

<dt id="GPLAndPlugins">If I write a plug-in to use with a GPL-covered

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GPLAndPlugins">#GPLAndPlugins</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins.  If the program
uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate
programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements
for them.</p>

<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a
single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main
program and the plug-ins.  This means you must license the plug-in
under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license and distribute
it with source code in a GPL-compliant way.</p>

<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication
between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of
the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a
borderline case.</p></dd>

If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the

<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function

single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main

GPL-covered plug-in with the non-free main program would violate the
GPL.  However, you can resolve that legal problem by adding an
exception to your plug-in's license, giving permission to link it with
the non-free main program.</p>

It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins.  For instance, if
the program uses <em>only</em> simple fork and exec to invoke and
communicate with plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate programs, so
the license of the plug-in makes no requirements about the main
program.</p>

<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function
calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a
single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main
program and the plug-ins.  In order to use the GPL-covered plug-ins,
the main program must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible
free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed
when the main program is distributed for use with these plug-ins.</p>

<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication

<dd><p>
Add this text to the license notice of each file in the package, at
the end of the text that says the file is distributed under the GNU
GPL:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Linking ABC statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on ABC.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.</p>

<p>As a special exception, the copyright holders of ABC give
you permission to combine ABC program with free software programs or
libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with independent
modules that communicate with ABC solely through the ABCDEF interface.
You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the
GNU GPL for ABC and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided
that you include the source code of that other code when and as the
GNU GPL requires distribution of source code and provided that you do not modify the ABCDEF interface.</p>

<p>Note that people who make modified versions of ABC are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.  If you modify the ABCDEF interface,
this exception does not apply to your modified version of ABC, and you
must remove this exception when you distribute your modified
version.</p>

<p>This exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the
GNU General Public License, version 3 (“GPLv3”)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This exception enables linking with differently licensed modules
over the specified interface (“ABCDEF”), while ensuring
that users would still receive source code as they normally would
under the GPL.</p>

<p>Only the copyright holders for the program can legally authorize this
exception. If you wrote the whole program yourself, then assuming your
employer or school does not claim the copyright, you are the copyright
holder—so you can authorize the exception. But if you want to use parts
of other GPL-covered programs by other authors in your code, you cannot
authorize the exception for them. You have to get the approval of the
copyright holders of those programs.</p></dd>


<dt id="ManyDifferentLicenses">I have written an application that links

<dd><p>
To answer this question, we would need to see a list of each component
that your program uses, the license of that component, and a brief (a
few sentences for each should suffice) describing how your library
uses that component.  Two examples would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make my software work, it must be linked to the FOO library,
    which is available under the Lesser GPL.</li>
<li>My software makes a system call (with a command line that I built) to
    run the BAR program, which is licensed under “the GPL, with a
    special exception allowing for linking with QUUX”.</li>

<dt id="MereAggregation">What is the difference between an
    “aggregate” and other kinds of “modified versions”?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#MereAggregation">#MereAggregation</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
An “aggregate” consists of a number of separate programs,
distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media.  The GPL permits
you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the
other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible.  The only condition is
that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users
from exercising rights that each program's individual license would
grant them.</p>

<p>Where's the line between two separate programs, and one program with two
parts?  This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide.  We
believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of
communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address
space, etc.)  and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of
information are interchanged).</p>

<p>If the modules are included in the same executable file, they are
definitely combined in one program.  If modules are designed to run
linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means
combining them into one program.</p>

<p>By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are
communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs.
So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are
separate programs.  But if the semantics of the communication are
intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too
could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger
program.</p></dd>


<dt id="AssignCopyright">Why does

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#AssignCopyright">#AssignCopyright</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Our lawyers have told us that to be in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html">best position to enforce the GPL</a> in
court against violators, we should keep the copyright status of the
program as simple as possible.  We do this by asking each contributor to
either assign the copyright on his contribution to the FSF, or disclaim
copyright on it and thus put it in the public domain.</p>

<p>We also ask individual contributors to get copyright disclaimers from
their employers (if any) so that we can be sure those employers won't
claim to own the contributions.</p>

<p>Of course, if all the contributors put their code in the public
domain, there is no copyright with which to enforce the GPL.  So we
encourage people to assign copyright on large code contributions, and
only put small changes in the public domain.</p>

<p>If you want to make an effort to enforce the GPL on your program, it

It is possible to make modified versions of the GPL, but it
tends to have practical consequences.</p>

<p>
You can legally use the GPL terms (possibly modified) in another license
provided that you call your license by another name and do not include
the GPL preamble, and provided you modify the instructions-for-use at

GNU (though the actual procedure you describe may be similar).</p>

<p> If you want to use our preamble in a modified license, please write

license requirements to see if we approve of them.</p>

<p>Although we will not raise legal objections to your making a modified
license in this way, we hope you will think twice and not do it.  Such
a modified license is almost certainly <a href="#WhatIsCompatible">
incompatible with the GNU GPL</a>, and that incompatibility blocks

<dt id="GPLInProprietarySystem">I'd like to incorporate GPL-covered
    software in my proprietary system.  Can I do this?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GPLInProprietarySystem">#GPLInProprietarySystem</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
You cannot incorporate GPL-covered software in a proprietary system.
The goal of the GPL is to grant everyone the freedom to copy,
redistribute, understand, and modify a program.  If you could
incorporate GPL-covered software into a non-free system, it would have
the effect of making the GPL-covered software non-free too.</p>

<p>A system incorporating a GPL-covered program is an extended version of
that program.  The GPL says that any extended version of the program
must be released under the GPL if it is released at all.  This is for
two reasons: to make sure that users who get the software get the
freedom they should have, and to encourage people to give back
improvements that they make.</p>

<p>However, in many cases you can distribute the GPL-covered software
alongside your proprietary system.  To do this validly, you must make
sure that the free and non-free programs communicate at arms length,
that they are not combined in a way that would make them
effectively a single program.</p>

<p>The difference between this and “incorporating” the GPL-covered
software is partly a matter of substance and partly form.  The substantive
part is this: if the two programs are combined so that they become
effectively two parts of one program, then you can't treat them as two
separate programs.  So the GPL has to cover the whole thing.</p>

<p>If the two programs remain well separated, like the compiler and the
kernel, or like an editor and a shell, then you can treat them as two
separate programs—but you have to do it properly.  The issue is
simply one of form: how you describe what you are doing.  Why do we
care about this?  Because we want to make sure the users clearly
understand the free status of the GPL-covered software in the
collection.</p>

<p>If people were to distribute GPL-covered software calling it
“part&nbsp;of” a system that users know is partly
proprietary, users might be uncertain of their rights regarding the
GPL-covered software.  But if they know that what they have received is
a free program plus another program, side by side, their rights will be
clear.</p></dd>


<dt id="GPLWrapper">I'd like to incorporate GPL-covered software in

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GPLWrapper">#GPLWrapper</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  The X11 license is compatible with the GPL, so you can add
a module to the GPL-covered program and put it under the X11 license.
But if you were to incorporate them both in a larger program, that
whole would include the GPL-covered part, so it would have to be
licensed <em>as a whole</em> under the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>The fact that proprietary module A communicates with GPL-covered
module C only through X11-licensed module B is legally irrelevant;
what matters is the fact that module C is included in the whole.</p></dd>

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#MoneyGuzzlerInc">#MoneyGuzzlerInc</a>)</span></dt>

There are two reasons for this.
First, a general one.  If we permitted company A to make a proprietary

that file, the effect would be to make a hole in the GPL big enough to
drive a truck through.  This would be carte blanche for withholding
the source code for all sorts of modifications and extensions to
GPL-covered software.</p>

<p>Giving all users access to the source code is one of our main goals,
so this consequence is definitely something we want to avoid.</p>

<p>More concretely, the versions of the programs linked with the Money
Guzzler libraries would not really be free software as we understand
the term—they would not come with full source code that enables users
to change and recompile the program.</p></dd>


<dt id="GPLIncompatibleAlone">If the license for a module Q has a

<dd><p>
If a program P is released under the GPL that means *any and every part of
it* can be used under the GPL.  If you integrate module Q, and release the
combined program P+Q under the GPL, that means any part of P+Q can be used
under the GPL.  One part of P+Q is Q.  So releasing P+Q under the GPL says
that Q any part of it can be used under the GPL.  Putting it in other
words, a user who obtains P+Q under the GPL can delete P, so that just Q
remains, still under the GPL.</p>

<p>If the license of module Q permits you to give permission for that,
then it is GPL-compatible.  Otherwise, it is not GPL-compatible.</p>

<p>If the license for Q says in no uncertain terms that you must do certain
things (not compatible with the GPL) when you redistribute Q on its own,

you can't release P+Q under the GPL either.  So you cannot link or combine

    is running a modified version of a GPL'ed program on a web site.
    Does the GPL say they must release their modified sources?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#UnreleasedMods">#UnreleasedMods</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
The GPL permits anyone to make a modified version and use it without
ever distributing it to others.  What this company is doing is a
special case of that.  Therefore, the company does not have to release
the modified sources.</p>

<p>It is essential for people to have the freedom to make modifications and
use them privately, without ever publishing those modifications.  However,
putting the program on a server machine for the public to talk to is hardly
“private” use, so it would be legitimate to require release of
the source code in that special case.  Developers who wish to address this
might want to use the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">GNU&nbsp;Affero&nbsp;GPL</a> for programs
designed for network server use.</p></dd>


<dt id="InternalDistribution">Is making and using multiple copies
    within one organization or company “distribution”?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#InternalDistribution">#InternalDistribution</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No, in that case the organization is just making the copies for
itself.  As a consequence, a company or other organization can develop
a modified version and install that version through its own
facilities, without giving the staff permission to release that
modified version to outsiders.</p>

<p>However, when the organization transfers copies to other organizations
or individuals, that is distribution.  In particular, providing copies
to contractors for use off-site is distribution.</p></dd>


<dt id="StolenCopy">If someone steals

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#StolenCopy">#StolenCopy</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
If the version has been released elsewhere, then the thief probably
does have the right to make copies and redistribute them under the GPL,
but if he is imprisoned for stealing the CD he may have to wait until
his release before doing so.</p>

<p>If the version in question is unpublished and considered by a company
to be its trade secret, then publishing it may be a violation of trade
secret law, depending on other circumstances.  The GPL does not change
that.  If the company tried to release its version and still treat it
as a trade secret, that would violate the GPL, but if the company
hasn't released this version, no such violation has occurred.</p></dd>


<dt id="TradeSecretRelease">What if a company distributes a copy as
    a trade secret?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#TradeSecretRelease">#TradeSecretRelease</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
If a company distributes a copy to you and claims it is a trade
secret, the company has violated the GPL and will have to cease
distribution.  Note how this differs from the theft case above; the
company does not intentionally distribute a copy when a copy is
stolen, so in that case the company has not violated the GPL.</p></dd>


<dt id="WhySomeGPLAndNotLGPL">Why are some GNU libraries released under
    the ordinary GPL rather than the Lesser GPL?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#WhySomeGPLAndNotLGPL">#WhySomeGPLAndNotLGPL</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Using the Lesser GPL for any particular library constitutes a retreat
for free software.  It means we partially abandon the attempt to
defend the users' freedom, and some of the requirements to share what
is built on top of GPL-covered software.  In themselves, those are
changes for the worse.</p>

<p>Sometimes a localized retreat is a good strategy.  Sometimes, using
the LGPL for a library might lead to wider use of that library, and
thus to more improvement for it, wider support for free software, and
so on.  This could be good for free software if it happens to a large
extent.  But how much will this happen?  We can only speculate.</p>

<p>It would be nice to try out the LGPL on each library for a while, see
whether it helps, and change back to the GPL if the LGPL didn't help.
But this is not feasible.  Once we use the LGPL for a particular
library, changing back would be difficult.</p>

<p>So we decide which license to use for each library on a case-by-case
basis.  There is a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">long
explanation</a> of how we judge the question.</p></dd>


<dt id="WillYouMakeAnException">Using a certain GNU program under the

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#WillYouMakeAnException">#WillYouMakeAnException</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Sorry, we don't make such exceptions.  It would not be right.</p>

<p>Maximizing the number of users is not our aim.  Rather, we are trying
to give the crucial freedoms to as many users as possible.  In
general, proprietary software projects hinder rather than help the
cause of freedom.</p>

<p>We do occasionally make license exceptions to assist a project which
is producing free software under a license other than the GPL.
However, we have to see a good reason why this will advance the cause
of free software.</p>

<p>We also do sometimes change the distribution terms of a package, when
that seems clearly the right way to serve the cause of free software;
but we are very cautious about this, so you will have to show us very
convincing reasons.</p></dd>


<dt id="VersionThreeOrLater">Why should programs say
    “Version&nbsp;3 of the GPL or any later version”?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#VersionThreeOrLater">#VersionThreeOrLater</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
From time to time, at intervals of years, we change the
GPL—sometimes to clarify it, sometimes to permit certain kinds of use
not previously permitted, and sometimes to tighten up a requirement.  (The
last two changes were in 2007 and 1991.)  Using this “indirect
pointer” in each program makes it possible for us to change the
distribution terms on the entire collection of GNU software, when we update
the GPL.</p>

<p>If each program lacked the indirect pointer, we would be forced to
discuss the change at length with numerous copyright holders, which would
be a virtual impossibility.  In practice, the chance of having uniform
distribution terms for GNU software would be nil.</p>

<p>Suppose a program says “Version 3 of the GPL or any later
version” and a new version of the GPL is released.  If the new GPL
version gives additional permission, that permission will be available
immediately to all the users of the program.  But if the new GPL version
has a tighter requirement, it will not restrict use of the current version
of the program, because it can still be used under GPL version&nbsp;3.  When a
program says “Version 3 of the GPL or any later version”, users
will always be permitted to use it, and even change it, according to the
terms of GPL version&nbsp;3—even after later versions of the GPL are
available.</p>

<p>If a tighter requirement in a new version of the GPL need not be obeyed
for existing software, how is it useful?  Once GPL version&nbsp;4 is available,
the developers of most GPL-covered programs will release subsequent
versions of their programs specifying “Version&nbsp;4 of the GPL or any
later version”.  Then users will have to follow the tighter
requirements in GPL version&nbsp;4, for subsequent versions of the program.</p>

<p>However, developers are not obligated to do this; developers can
continue allowing use of the previous version of the GPL, if that is their
preference.</p></dd>


<dt id="OnlyLatestVersion">Is it a good idea to use a license saying
    that a certain program can be used only under the latest version
    of the GNU GPL?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#OnlyLatestVersion">#OnlyLatestVersion</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
The reason you shouldn't do that is that it could result some
day in withdrawing automatically some permissions that the users
previously had.</p>

<p>Suppose a program was released in 2000 under “the latest GPL
version”.  At that time, people could have used it under GPLv2.
The day we published GPLv3 in 2007, everyone would have been suddenly
compelled to use it under GPLv3 instead.</p>

<p>Some users may not even have known about GPL version 3—but
they would have been required to use it.  They could have violated the
program's license unintentionally just because they did not get the
news.  That's a bad way to treat people.</p>

<p>We think it is wrong to take back permissions already granted,
except due to a violation.  If your freedom could be revoked, then it
isn't really freedom.  Thus, if you get a copy of a program version
under one version of a license, you should <em>always</em> have the
rights granted by that version of the license.  Releasing under
“GPL version&nbsp;N or any later version” upholds that
principle.</p></dd>


<dt id="WhyNotGPLForManuals">Why don't you use the GPL for manuals?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#WhyNotGPLForManuals">#WhyNotGPLForManuals</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
It is possible to use the GPL for a manual, but the GNU Free
Documentation License (GFDL) is much better for manuals.</p>

<p>The GPL was designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses
that are crucial for programs, but that would be cumbersome and
unnecessary for a book or manual.  For instance, anyone publishing the
book on paper would have to either include machine-readable “source
code” of the book along with each printed copy, or provide a written
offer to send the “source code” later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the GFDL has clauses that help publishers of free manuals
make a profit from selling copies—cover texts, for instance.  The
special rules for Endorsements sections make it possible to use the
GFDL for an official standard.  This would permit modified versions,
but they could not be labeled as “the standard”.</p>

<p>Using the GFDL, we permit changes in the text of a manual that covers
its technical topic.  It is important to be able to change the
technical parts, because people who change a program ought to change
the documentation to correspond.  The freedom to do this is an
ethical imperative.</p>

<p>Our manuals also include sections that state our political position
about free software.  We mark these as “invariant”, so that
they cannot be changed or removed.  The GFDL makes provisions for these
“invariant sections”.</p></dd>


<dt id="FontException">How does the GPL apply to fonts?

Font licensing is a complex issue which needs serious
consideration.  The following license exception is experimental but
approved for general use.  We welcome suggestions on this

<p>To use this exception, add this text to the license notice of each

that says the file is distributed under the GNU GPL:</p>

<blockquote><p>
As a special exception, if you create a document which uses

the document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting

exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the

Templates are minor enough that it is not worth using copyleft to
protect them.  It is normally harmless to use copyleft on minor works,
but templates are a special case, because they are combined with data
provided by users of the application and the combination is
distributed.  So, we recommend that you license your templates under
simple permissive terms.</p>

<p>Some templates make calls into JavaScript functions.  Since
Javascript is often non-trivial, it is worth copylefting.  Because the
templates will be combined with user data, it's possible that
template+user data+JavaScript would be considered one work under
copyright law.  A line needs to be drawn between the JavaScript
(copylefted), and the user code (usually under incompatible terms).</p>

<blockquote><p>As a special exception to the GPL, any HTML file which

it by reference shall be deemed a separate work for copyright law
purposes.  In addition, the copyright holders of this code give you
permission to combine this code with free software libraries that are
released under the GNU LGPL.  You may copy and distribute such a system
following the terms of the GNU GPL for this code and the LGPL for the
libraries.  If you modify this code, you may extend this exception to
your version of the code, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do

<dd><p>
Which programs you used to edit the source code, or to compile it, or

concerning the licensing of that source code.</p>

<p>However, if you link non-free libraries with the source code, that
would be an issue you need to deal with.  It does not preclude
releasing the source code under the GPL, but if the libraries don't
fit under the “system library” exception, you should affix
an explicit notice giving permission to link your program with
them.  <a href="#GPLIncompatibleLibs">The FAQ entry about using

<dt id="GPLTranslations">Are there translations
    of the GPL into other languages?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GPLTranslations">#GPLTranslations</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
It would be useful to have translations of the GPL into languages
other than English.  People have even written translations and sent
them to us.  But we have not dared to approve them as officially
valid.  That carries a risk so great we do not dare accept it.</p>

<p>A legal document is in some ways like a program.  Translating it is
like translating a program from one language and operating system to
another.  Only a lawyer skilled in both languages can do it—and even
then, there is a risk of introducing a bug.</p>

<p>If we were to approve, officially, a translation of the GPL, we would
be giving everyone permission to do whatever the translation says they
can do.  If it is a completely accurate translation, that is fine.
But if there is an error in the translation, the results could be a
disaster which we could not fix.</p>

<p>If a program has a bug, we can release a new version, and eventually
the old version will more or less disappear.  But once we have given
everyone permission to act according to a particular translation, we
have no way of taking back that permission if we find, later on, that
it had a bug.</p>

<p>Helpful people sometimes offer to do the work of translation for us.
If the problem were a matter of finding someone to do the work, this
would solve it.  But the actual problem is the risk of error, and
offering to do the work does not avoid the risk.  We could not
possibly authorize a translation written by a non-lawyer.</p>

<p>Therefore, for the time being, we are not approving translations
of the GPL as globally valid and binding.  Instead, we are doing two
things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Referring people to unofficial translations.
  This means that we permit people to write translations of the GPL, but
  we don't approve them as legally valid and binding.</p>

  <p>An unapproved translation has no legal force, and it should say so
  explicitly.  It should be marked as follows:</p>

  <blockquote><p>
    This translation of the GPL is informal, and not officially approved
    by the Free Software Foundation as valid.  To be completely sure of
    what is permitted, refer to the original GPL (in English).
  </p></blockquote>

  <p>But the unapproved translation can serve as a hint for how to
  understand the English GPL.  For many users, that is sufficient.</p>

  <p>However, businesses using GNU software in commercial activity, and
  people doing public ftp distribution, should need to check the real
  English GPL to make sure of what it permits.</p></li>

<li><p>Publishing translations valid for a single country only.</p>

  <p>We are considering the idea of publishing translations which are
  officially valid only for one country.  This way, if there is a mistake, it
  will be limited to that country, and the damage will not be too great.</p>

  <p>It will still take considerable expertise and effort from a sympathetic
  and capable lawyer to make a translation, so we cannot promise any
  such translations soon.</p></li>

<dt id="InterpreterIncompat">If a programming language interpreter has a
    license that is incompatible with the GPL, can I run GPL-covered
    programs on it?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#InterpreterIncompat">#InterpreterIncompat</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
When the interpreter just interprets a language, the answer is yes.
The interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; the GPL
doesn't restrict what tools you process the program with.</p>

<p>However, when the interpreter is extended to provide
“bindings” to other facilities (often, but not necessarily,
libraries), the interpreted program is effectively linked to the facilities
it uses through these bindings.  The JNI or Java Native Interface is an
example of such a facility; libraries that are accessed in this way are
linked dynamically with the Java programs that call them.</p>

<p>So if these facilities are released under a GPL-incompatible license,
the situation is like linking in any other way with a GPL-incompatible
library.  Which implies that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are writing code and releasing it under the GPL, you can
  state an explicit exception giving permission to link it with those
  GPL-incompatible facilities.</li>

  <li>If you wrote and released the program under the GPL, and you
  designed it specifically to work with those facilities, people can
  take that as an implicit exception permitting them to link it with
  those facilities.  But if that is what you intend, it is better
  to say so explicitly.</li>

  <li>You can't take someone else's GPL-covered code and use it that
  way, or add such exceptions to it.  Only the copyright holders of that
  code can add the exception.</li>

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#PortProgramToGL">#PortProgramToGL</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
In general, the answer is no—this is not a legal requirement.  In
specific, the answer depends on which libraries you want to use and what
their licenses are.  Most system libraries either use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser GPL</a>, or use the GNU GPL plus an
exception permitting linking the library with anything.  These libraries
can be used in non-free programs; but in the case of the Lesser GPL, it
does have some requirements you must follow.</p>

<p>Some libraries are released under the GNU GPL alone; you must use a
GPL-compatible license to use those libraries.  But these are normally
the more specialized libraries, and you would not have had anything much
like them on another platform, so you probably won't find yourself
wanting to use these libraries for simple porting.</p>

<p>Of course, your software is not a contribution to our community if it is
not free, and people who value their freedom will refuse to use it.
Only people willing to give up their freedom will use your software,
which means that it will effectively function as an inducement for people
to lose their freedom.</p>

<p>If you hope some day to look back on your career and feel that
it has contributed to the growth of a good and free society, you
need to make your software free.</p></dd>


<dt id="CompanyGPLCostsMoney">I just found out that a company has a

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#CompanyGPLCostsMoney">#CompanyGPLCostsMoney</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  The GPL does not require anyone to use the Internet for
distribution.  It also does not require anyone in particular to
redistribute the program.  And (outside of one special case), even if
someone does decide to redistribute the program sometimes, the GPL
doesn't say he has to distribute a copy to you in particular, or any
other person in particular.</p>

<p>What the GPL requires is that he must have the freedom to distribute a

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#ReleaseNotOriginal">#ReleaseNotOriginal</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  Such a license would be self-contradictory.  Let's look at its 
implications for me as a user.</p>

<p>Suppose I start with the original version (call it version A), add 
some code (let's imagine it is 1000 lines), and release that modified 
version (call it B) under the GPL.  The GPL says anyone can change 
version B again and release the result under the GPL.  So I (or 
someone else) can delete those 1000 lines, producing version C which 
has the same code as version A but is under the GPL.</p>

<p>If you try to block that path, by saying explicitly in the license that 
I'm not allowed to reproduce something identical to version A under 
the GPL by deleting those lines from version B, in effect the license 
now says that I can't fully use version B in all the ways that the GPL 
permits.  In other words, the license does not in fact allow a user to 
release a modified version such as B under the GPL.</p></dd>

Whether moving a copy to or from this subsidiary constitutes
“distribution” is a matter to be decided in each case under the

but appears not to consider this distribution.</p>

<p>If, in some country, this is considered distribution, and the

controlled by the parent company; rights or no rights, it won't

This is neither required nor forbidden.  With or without a click

    violation of those distributors' obligations under GPL?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#ExportWarranties">#ExportWarranties</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This is not a violation of the GPL.  Those distributors (almost
all of whom are commercial businesses selling free software
distributions and related services) are trying to reduce their own
legal risks, not to control your behavior.  Export control law in the
United States <em>might</em> make them liable if they knowingly export
software into certain countries, or if they give software to parties
they know will make such exports.  By asking for these statements from
their customers and others to whom they distribute software, they
protect themselves in the event they are later asked by regulatory
authorities what they knew about where software they distributed was
going to wind up.  They are not restricting what you can do with the
software, only preventing themselves from being blamed with respect to
anything you do.  Because they are not placing additional restrictions
on the software, they do not violate section 10 of GPLv3 or section 6
of GPLv2.</p>

<p>The FSF opposes the application of US export control laws to free
software.  Not only are such laws incompatible with the general
objective of software freedom, they achieve no reasonable governmental
purpose, because free software is currently and should always be
available from parties in almost every country, including countries
that have no export control laws and which do not participate in
US-led trade embargoes.  Therefore, no country's government is
actually deprived of free software by US export control laws, while no
country's citizens <em>should</em> be deprived of free software,
regardless of their governments' policies, as far as we are concerned.
Copies of all GPL-licensed software published by the FSF can be
obtained from us without making any representation about where you
live or what you intend to do.  At the same time, the FSF understands
the desire of commercial distributors located in the US to comply with
US laws.  They have a right to choose to whom they distribute
particular copies of free software; exercise of that right does not
violate the GPL unless they add contractual restrictions beyond those
permitted by the GPL.</p></dd>

<p>Second, replace all your existing v2 license notices (usually at
the top of each file) with the new recommended text available on
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html">the GNU licenses howto</a>.  It's
more future-proof because it no longer includes the FSF's postal
mailing address.</p>

<p>Of course, any descriptive text (such as in a README) which talks about
the package's license should also be updated appropriately.</p></dd>


<dt id="BitTorrent">How does GPLv3 make BitTorrent distribution easier?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#BitTorrent">#BitTorrent</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Because GPLv2 was written before peer-to-peer distribution of
software was common, it is difficult to meet its requirements when you
share code this way.  The best way to make sure you are in compliance
when distributing GPLv2 object code on BitTorrent would be to include
all the corresponding source in the same torrent, which is
prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p>GPLv3 addresses this problem in two ways.  First, people who
download this torrent and send the data to others as part of that
process are not required to do anything.  That's because section 9
says “Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
likewise does not require acceptance [of the license].”</p>

<p>Second, section 6(e) of GPLv3 is designed to give
distributors—people who initially seed torrents—a clear and
straightforward way to provide the source, by telling recipients where it
is available on a public network server.  This ensures that everyone who
wants to get the source can do so, and it's almost no hassle for the
distributor.</p></dd>


<dt id="Tivoization">What is tivoization? How does GPLv3 prevent it?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#Tivoization">#Tivoization</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Some devices utilize free software that can be upgraded, but are
designed so that users are not allowed to modify that software.  There
are lots of different ways to do this; for example, sometimes the
hardware checksums the software that is installed, and shuts down if
it doesn't match an expected signature.  The manufacturers comply with
GPLv2 by giving you the source code, but you still don't have the
freedom to modify the software you're using.  We call this practice
tivoization.</p>

<p>When people distribute User Products that include software under
GPLv3, section 6 requires that they provide you with information
necessary to modify that software.  User Products is a term specially
defined in the license; examples of User Products include portable
music players, digital video recorders, and home security systems.</p></dd>


<dt id="DRMProhibited">Does GPLv3 prohibit DRM?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#DRMProhibited">#DRMProhibited</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
It does not; you can use code released under GPLv3 to develop any
kind of DRM technology you like.  However, if you do this, section 3
says that the system will not count as an effective technological
“protection” measure, which means that if someone breaks the
DRM, he will be free to distribute his software too, unhindered by the DMCA
and similar laws.</p>

<p>As usual, the GNU GPL does not restrict what people do in software,
it just stops them from restricting others.</p></dd>


<dt id="GPLHardware">Can I use the GPL to license hardware?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GPLHardware">#GPLHardware</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Any material that can be copyrighted can be licensed under the GPL.
GPLv3 can also be used to license materials covered by other
copyright-like laws, such as semiconductor masks.  So, as an example,
you can release a drawing of a physical object or circuit under the
GPL.</p>

<p>In many situations, copyright does not cover making physical
hardware from a drawing.  In these situations, your license for the
drawing simply can't exert any control over making or selling physical
hardware, regardless of the license you use.  When copyright does
cover making hardware, for instance with IC masks, the GPL handles
that case in a useful way.</p></dd>


<dt id="GiveUpKeys">I use public key cryptography to sign my code to
    assure its authenticity. Is it true that GPLv3 forces me to release
    my private signing keys?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#GiveUpKeys">#GiveUpKeys</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  The only time you would be required to release signing keys is
if you conveyed GPLed software inside a User Product, and its hardware
checked the software for a valid cryptographic signature before it
would function. In that specific case, you would be required to
provide anyone who owned the device, on demand, with the key to sign
and install modified software on his device so that it will run.  If
each instance of the device uses a different key, then you need only
give each purchaser the key for his instance.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3VotingMachine">Does GPLv3 require that voters be able to
    modify the software running in a voting machine?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3VotingMachine">#v3VotingMachine</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  Companies distributing devices that include software under
GPLv3 are at most required to provide the source and Installation
Information for the software to people who possess a copy of the
object code.  The voter who uses a voting machine (like any other
kiosk) doesn't get possession of it, not even temporarily, so the
voter also does not get possession of the binary software in it.</p>

<p>Note, however, that voting is a very special case.  Just because
the software in a computer is free does not mean you can trust the
computer for voting.  We believe that computers cannot be trusted for
voting. Voting should be done on paper.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3PatentRetaliation">Does GPLv3 have a “patent retaliation
    clause”?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3PatentRetaliation">#v3PatentRetaliation</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
In effect, yes.  Section 10 prohibits people who convey the
software from filing patent suits against other licensees.  If someone
did so anyway, section 8 explains how they would lose their license
and any patent licenses that accompanied it.</p></dd>


<dt id="SourceCodeInDocumentation">Can I use snippets of GPL-covered
    source code within documentation that is licensed under some license
    that is incompatible with the GPL?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#SourceCodeInDocumentation">#SourceCodeInDocumentation</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
If the snippets are small enough that you can incorporate them
under fair use or similar laws, then yes.  Otherwise, no.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3Under4and5">The beginning of GPLv3 section 6 says that I can
    convey a covered work in object code form “under the terms of
    sections 4 and 5” provided I also meet the conditions of
    section 6.  What does that mean?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3Under4and5">#v3Under4and5</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This means that all the permissions and conditions you have to
convey source code also apply when you convey object code: you may
charge a fee, you must keep copyright notices intact, and so on.</p></dd>


<dt id="v2OrLaterPatentLicense">My company owns a lot of patents.
    Over the years we've contributed code to projects under “GPL
    version&nbsp;2 or any later version”, and the project itself has
    been distributed under the same terms. If a user decides to take the
    project's code (incorporating my contributions) under GPLv3, does
    that mean I've automatically granted GPLv3's explicit patent license
    to that user?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v2OrLaterPatentLicense">#v2OrLaterPatentLicense</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  When you convey GPLed software, you must follow the terms and
conditions of one particular version of the license.  When you do so,
that version defines the obligations you have.  If users may also
elect to use later versions of the GPL, that's merely an additional
permission they have—it does not require you to fulfill the
terms of the later version of the GPL as well.</p>

<p>Do not take this to mean that you can threaten the community with
your patents.  In many countries, distributing software under GPLv2
provides recipients with an implicit patent license to exercise their
rights under the GPL.  Even if it didn't, anyone considering enforcing
their patents aggressively is an enemy of the community, and we will
defend ourselves against such an attack.</p></dd>


<dt id="LGPLv3ContributorVersion">If I distribute a proprietary
    program that links against an LGPLv3-covered library that I've
    modified, what is the “contributor version” for purposes of

    combination?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#LGPLv3ContributorVersion">#LGPLv3ContributorVersion</a>)</span></dt>

The “contributor version” is only your version of the

<dt id="v2v3Compatibility">Is GPLv3 compatible with GPLv2?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v2v3Compatibility">#v2v3Compatibility</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  Some of the requirements in GPLv3, such as the requirement to
provide Installation Information, do not exist in GPLv2.  As a result,
the licenses are not compatible: if you tried to combine code released
under both these licenses, you would violate section 6 of GPLv2.</p>

<p>However, if code is released under GPL “version 2 or
later,” that is compatible with GPLv3 because GPLv3 is one of the
options it permits.</p></dd>


<dt id="Cure">What does it mean to “cure” a violation of GPLv3?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#Cure">#Cure</a>)</span></dt>

To cure a violation means to adjust your practices to comply with
the requirements of the license.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3InternationalDisclaimers">The warranty and liability

    disclaimers to my own code?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3InternationalDisclaimers">#v3InternationalDisclaimers</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Yes.  Section 7 gives you permission to add your own disclaimers,
specifically 7(a).</p></dd>


<dt id="NonvisualLegalNotices">My program has interactive user

    Appropriate Legal Notices requirement in GPLv3?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#NonvisualLegalNotices">#NonvisualLegalNotices</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
All you need to do is ensure that the Appropriate Legal Notices are
readily available to the user in your interface.  For example, if you
have written an audio interface, you could include a command that
reads the notices aloud.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3CoworkerConveying">If I give a copy of a GPLv3-covered

 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3CoworkerConveying">#v3CoworkerConveying</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
As long as you're both using the software in your work at the
company, rather than personally, then the answer is no.  The copies
belong to the company, not to you or the coworker.  This copying is
propagation, not conveying, because the company is not making copies
available to others.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3ConditionalWarranty">If I distribute a GPLv3-covered

    the program?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3ConditionalWarranty">#v3ConditionalWarranty</a>)</span></dt>

Yes.  Just as devices do not need to be warranted if users modify
the software inside them, you are not required to provide a warranty
that covers all possible activities someone could undertake with
GPLv3-covered software.</p></dd>


<dt id="SeparateAffero">Why did you decide to write the GNU Affero GPLv3
    as a separate license?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#SeparateAffero">#SeparateAffero</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Early drafts of GPLv3 allowed licensors to add an Affero-like
requirement to publish source in section 7.  However, some companies
that develop and rely upon free software consider this requirement to
be too burdensome.  They want to avoid code with this requirement, and
expressed concern about the administrative costs of checking code for
this additional requirement.  By publishing the GNU Affero GPLv3 as a
separate license, with provisions in it and GPLv3 to allow code under
these licenses to link to each other, we accomplish all of our
original goals while making it easier to determine which code has the
source publication requirement.</p></dd>


<dt id="WhyPropagateAndConvey">Why did you invent the new terms
    “propagate” and “convey” in GPLv3?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#WhyPropagateAndConvey">#WhyPropagateAndConvey</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
The term “distribute” used in GPLv2 was borrowed from
United States copyright law.  Over the years, we learned that some
jurisdictions used this same word in their own copyright laws, but gave
it different meanings. We invented these new terms to make our intent as
clear as possible no matter where the license is interpreted.  They are
not used in any copyright law in the world, and we provide their
definitions directly in the license.</p></dd>


<dt id="NoMilitary">I'd like to license my code under the GPL, but I'd
    also like to make it clear that it can't be used for military and/or
    commercial uses. Can I do this?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#NoMilitary">#NoMilitary</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No, because those two goals contradict each other.  The GNU GPL is
designed specifically to prevent the addition of further restrictions.
GPLv3 allows a very limited set of them, in section 7, but any other
added restriction can be removed by the user.</p></dd>


<dt id="ConveyVsDistribute">Is “convey” in GPLv3 the same
    thing as what GPLv2 means by “distribute”?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#ConveyVsDistribute">#ConveyVsDistribute</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Yes, more or less.  During the course of enforcing GPLv2, we
learned that some jurisdictions used the word “distribute” in their
own copyright laws, but gave it different meanings.  We invented a new
term to make our intent clear and avoid any problems that could be
caused by these differences.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3MakingAvailable">GPLv3 gives “making available to the
    public” as an example of propagation.  What does this mean?
    Is making available a form of conveying?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3MakingAvailable">#v3MakingAvailable</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
One example of “making available to the public” is putting the
software on a public web or FTP server.  After you do this, some time
may pass before anybody actually obtains the software from
you—but because it could happen right away, you need to fulfill
the GPL's obligations right away as well.  Hence, we defined conveying
to include this activity.</p></dd>


<dt id="PropagationNotConveying">Since distribution and making
    available to the public are forms of propagation that are also
    conveying in GPLv3, what are some examples of propagation that do not
    constitute conveying?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#PropagationNotConveying">#PropagationNotConveying</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Making copies of the software for yourself is the main form of
propagation that is not conveying.  You might do this to install the
software on multiple computers, or to make backups.</p></dd>


<dt id="Prelinking">Does prelinking a
    GPLed binary to various libraries on the system, to optimize its
    performance, count as modification?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#Prelinking">#Prelinking</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  Prelinking is part of a compilation process; it doesn't
introduce any license requirements above and beyond what other aspects
of compilation would.  If you're allowed to link the program to the
libraries at all, then it's fine to prelink with them as well.  If you
distribute prelinked object code, you need to follow the terms of
section&nbsp;6.</p></dd>


<dt id="LaptopLoan">If someone installs GPLed software on a laptop, and
    then lends that laptop to a friend without providing source code for
    the software, have they violated the GPL?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#LaptopLoan">#LaptopLoan</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  In the jurisdictions where we have investigated this issue,
this sort of loan would not count as conveying.  The laptop's owner
would not have any obligations under the GPL.</p></dd>


<dt id="TwoPartyTivoization">Suppose that two companies try to
    circumvent the requirement to provide Installation Information by
    having one company release signed software, and the other release a
    User Product that only runs signed software from the first company. Is
    this a violation of GPLv3?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#TwoPartyTivoization">#TwoPartyTivoization</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
Yes.  If two parties try to work together to get around the
requirements of the GPL, they can both be pursued for copyright
infringement.  This is especially true since the definition of convey
explicitly includes activities that would make someone responsible for
secondary infringement.</p></dd>


<dt id="SourceInCVS">Am I complying with GPLv3 if I offer binaries on an
    FTP server and sources by way of a link to a source code repository
    in a version control system, like CVS or Subversion?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#SourceInCVS">#SourceInCVS</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This is acceptable as long as the source checkout process does not
become burdensome or otherwise restrictive.  Anybody who can download
your object code should also be able to check out source from your
version control system, using a publicly available free software
client.  Users should be provided with clear and convenient
instructions for how to get the source for the exact object code they
downloaded—they may not necessarily want the latest development
code, after all.</p></dd>


<dt id="RemoteAttestation">Can someone who conveys GPLv3-covered
    software in a User Product use remote attestation to prevent a user
    from modifying that software?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#RemoteAttestation">#RemoteAttestation</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
No.  The definition of Installation Information, which must be
provided with source when the software is conveyed inside a User
Product, explicitly says: “The information must suffice to ensure that
the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been
made.”  If the device uses remote attestation in some way, the
Installation Information must provide you some means for your modified
software to report itself as legitimate.</p></dd>


<dt id="RulesProtocols">What does “rules and protocols for
    communication across the network” mean in GPLv3?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#RulesProtocols">#RulesProtocols</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This refers to rules about traffic you can send over the network.  For
example, if there is a limit on the number of requests you can send to a
server per day, or the size of a file you can upload somewhere, your access
to those resources may be denied if you do not respect those limits.</p>

<p>These rules do not include anything that does not pertain directly to
data traveling across the network.  For instance, if a server on the
network sent messages for users to your device, your access to the network
could not be denied merely because you modified the software so that it did
not display the messages.</p></dd>


<dt id="SupportService">Distributors that provide Installation Information
    under GPLv3 are not required to provide “support service”
    for the product. What kind of “support service”do you mean?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#SupportService">#SupportService</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This includes the kind of service many device manufacturers provide to
help you install, use, or troubleshoot the product.  If a device relies on
access to web services or similar technology to function properly, those
should normally still be available to modified versions, subject to the
terms in section 6 regarding access to a network.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3Notwithstanding">In GPLv3 and AGPLv3, what does it mean when it
    says “notwithstanding any other provision of this License”?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3Notwithstanding">#v3Notwithstanding</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This simply means that the following terms prevail over anything
else in the license that may conflict with them.  For example, without this
text, some people might have claimed that you could not combine code under
GPLv3 with code under AGPLv3, because the AGPL's additional requirements
would be classified as “further restrictions” under section 7
of GPLv3.  This text makes clear that our intended interpretation is the
correct one, and you can make the combination.</p>

<p>This text only resolves conflicts between different terms of the license.
When there is no conflict between two conditions, then you must meet them
both.  These paragraphs don't grant you carte blanche to ignore the rest of
the license—instead they're carving out very limited exceptions.</p></dd>


<dt id="AGPLv3CorrespondingSource">Under AGPLv3, when I modify the Program
    under section 13, what Corresponding Source does it have to offer?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#AGPLv3CorrespondingSource">#AGPLv3CorrespondingSource</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
“Corresponding Source” is defined in section 1 of the
license, and you should provide what it lists.  So, if your modified
version depends on libraries under other licenses, such as the Expat
license or GPLv3, the Corresponding Source should include those libraries
(unless they are System Libraries).  If you have modified those libraries,
you must provide your modified source code for them.</p>

<p>The last sentence of the first paragraph of section 13 is only meant to
reinforce what most people would have naturally assumed: even though
combinations with code under GPLv3 are handled through a special exception
in section 13, the Corresponding Source should still include the code that
is combined with the Program this way.  This sentence does not mean that
you <em>only</em> have to provide the source that's covered under GPLv3;
instead it means that such code is <em>not</em> excluded from the
definition of Corresponding Source.</p></dd>


<dt id="AGPLv3InteractingRemotely">In AGPLv3, what counts as
    “interacting with [the software] remotely through a computer
    network?”
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#AGPLv3InteractingRemotely">#AGPLv3InteractingRemotely</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
If the program is expressly designed to accept user requests and send
responses over a network, then it meets these criteria.  Common examples of
programs that would fall into this category include web and mail servers,
interactive web-based applications, and servers for games that are played
online.</p>

<p>If a program is not expressly designed to interact with a user through a
network, but is being run in an environment where it happens to do so, then
it does not fall into this category.  For example, an application is not
required to provide source merely because the user is running it over SSH,
or a remote X session.</p></dd>

<dt id="ApacheLegalEntity">How does GPLv3's concept of
    “you” compare to the definition of “Legal Entity”
    in the Apache License 2.0?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#ApacheLegalEntity">#ApacheLegalEntity</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
They're effectively identical.  The definition of “Legal
Entity” in the Apache License 2.0 is very standard in various kinds
of legal agreements—so much so that it would be very surprising if a
court did not interpret the term in the same way in the absence of an
explicit definition.  We fully expect them to do the same when they look at
GPLv3 and consider who qualifies as a licensee.</p></dd>


<dt id="v3TheProgram">In GPLv3, what does “the Program”
    refer to?  Is it every program ever released under GPLv3?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#v3TheProgram">#v3TheProgram</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
The term “the Program” means one particular work that is
licensed under GPLv3 and is received by a particular licensee from an
upstream licensor or distributor.  The Program is the particular work of
software that you received in a given instance of GPLv3 licensing, as you
received it.</p>

<p>“The Program” cannot mean “all the works ever licensed
under GPLv3”; that interpretation makes no sense for a number of
reasons.  We've published

Nothing.  The GPL does not place any conditions on this activity.</p></dd>


<dt id="AGPLv3ServerAsUser">If some network client software is

    the servers it interacts with?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#AGPLv3ServerAsUser">#AGPLv3ServerAsUser</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
This should not be required in any typical server-client
relationship.  AGPLv3 requires a program to offer source code to
“all users interacting with it remotely through a computer
network.” In most server-client architectures, it simply
wouldn't be reasonable to argue that the server operator is a
“user” interacting with the client in any meaningful
sense.</p>

<p>Consider HTTP as an example.  All HTTP clients expect servers to
provide certain functionality: they should send specified responses to
well-formed requests.  The reverse is not true: servers cannot assume
that the client will do anything in particular with the data they
send.  The client may be a web browser, an RSS reader, a spider, a
network monitoring tool, or some special-purpose program.  The server
can make absolutely no assumptions about what the client will
do—so there's no meaningful way for the server operator to be
considered a user of that software.</p></dd>

<dt id="AGPLProxy">For software that runs a proxy server licensed

    interacting with that code?
  <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#AGPLProxy">#AGPLProxy</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>For software on a proxy server, you can provide an offer of
source through a normal method of delivering messages to users of that
kind of proxy. For example, a Web proxy could use a landing page. When
users initially start using the proxy, you can direct them to a page
with the offer of source along with any other information you choose
to provide.</p>
<p>The AGPL says you must make the offer to "all users".  If you know
that a certain user has already been shown the offer, for the current
version of the software, you don't have to repeat it to that user

<dt id="AllCompatibility">How are the various GNU licenses
    compatible with each other?
 <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#AllCompatibility">#AllCompatibility</a>)</span></dt>
<dd><p>
The various GNU licenses enjoy broad compatibility between each
other.  The only time you may not be able to combine code under two of
these licenses is when you want to use code that's <em>only</em> under
an older version of a license with code that's under a newer
version.</p>

<p>Below is a detailed compatibility matrix for various combinations of the
GNU licenses, to provide an easy-to-use reference for specific cases.  It
assumes that someone else has written some software under one of these
licenses, and you want to somehow incorporate code from that into a project
that you're releasing (either your own original work, or a modified version
of someone else's software). Find the license for your project in a
column at the top of the table, and the license for the other code in a row
on the left. The cell where they meet will tell you whether or not this
combination is permitted.</p>

<p>When we say “copy code,” we mean just that: you're taking a
section of code from one source, with or without modification, and
inserting it into your own program, thus forming a work based on the first
section of code.  “Use a library” means that you're not copying
any source directly, but instead interacting with it through linking,
importing, or other typical mechanisms that bind the sources together when
you compile or run the code.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-1">1: You must follow the terms of GPLv2
when incorporating the code in this case. You cannot take advantage of
terms in later versions of the GPL.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-2">2: While you may release your project
(either your original work and/or work that you received and modified)
under GPLv2-or-later in this case, note that the other code you're
using must remain under GPLv2 only.  As long as your project depends
on that code, you won't be able to upgrade the license of your project
to GPLv3-or-later, and the work as a whole (any combination of both
your project and the other code) can only be conveyed under the terms
of GPLv2.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-3">3: If you have the ability to release
the project under GPLv2 or any later version, you can choose to
release it under GPLv3 or any later version—and once you do
that, you'll be able to incorporate the code released under GPLv3.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-4">4: If you have the ability to release
the project under LGPLv2.1 or any later version, you can choose to
release it under LGPLv3 or any later version—and once you do
that, you'll be able to incorporate the code released under
LGPLv3.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-5">5: You must follow the terms of
LGPLv2.1 when incorporating the code in this case. You cannot take
advantage of terms in later versions of the LGPL.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-6">6: If you do this, as long as the
project contains the code released under LGPLv2.1 only, you will not
be able to upgrade the project's license to LGPLv3 or later.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-7">7: LGPLv2.1 gives you permission to
relicense the code under any version of the GPL since GPLv2.  If you
can switch the LGPLed code in this case to using an appropriate
version of the GPL instead (as noted in the table), you can make this
combination.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-8">8: LGPLv3 is GPLv3 plus extra
permissions that you can ignore in this case.</p>

<p id="compat-matrix-footnote-9">9: Because GPLv2 does not permit
combinations with LGPLv3, you must convey the project under GPLv3's
terms in this case, since it will allow that combination.</p>
