</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Let’s assume you start a new map completely from scratch. If you want to ease your job and get meaningful intermediate results we recommend to do your map in the following order.
</div>
<ul>
<li>
z$clientsizemin/max and z$targetsize first. They are absolutely necessary for connection.
</li>
<li>
s$titletext next. Juts like clientsize it is necessary for connection, because it might be that other applications or other casino tables have the same window size. Choose something unique like &ldquo;No Limit Hold’em - Logged in as&rdquo;. Once you have defined these two items and put this map into your scraper folder OpenHoldem will be able to connect to the table even if it does not yet scrape anything. but the autoplayer button should become active — and you will get lots of warnings at load-time because of an incomplete map.
</li>
<li>
s$nchairs next. OpenHoldem needs to know how many chairs are supported by the tablemap. OpenScrapes region-cloner needs this info too if it clones the regions of player 0 to all other players.
</li>
<li>
r$pXseated for all chairs 0..n-1 or at least for chair 0 if you make use of the region-cloner thereafter. This is usually an easy hash returning true/false like the following three items.
</li>
<li>
r$pXactive to determine if a player is sitting in.
</li>
<li>
r$p0cardback, r$pXcardface0nocard and r$pXcardface1nocard. It is usually easy to do these hashes and you can now recognize all cards except your own hole-cards.
</li>
<li>
r$pXdealer to know who is the dealer. 
</li>
<li>
r$c0cardfaceXnocard and r$c0cardfaceX. The community cards
</li>
<li>
r$pXcardface0 and r$pXcardface1. The player cards.
</li>
<li>
r$pXbet and pXbalance. This usually requires text-scraping and sometimes chip-scraping and is probably the most time-consuming part of the job.
</li>
<li>
r$iXbutton, r$iXlabel and r$iXstate. The basic action buttons
</li>
<li>
r$i3edit, s$betsizeconfirmationmethod, s$betsizedeletionmethod, s$betsizeselectionmethod and s$betsizeinterpretationmethod if you want to create a no-limit or pot-limit-map.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
That’s it. Now you are ready to start playing.
