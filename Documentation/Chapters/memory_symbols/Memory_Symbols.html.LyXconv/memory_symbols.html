<h2 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1"></a>Introduction 
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
One of the most powerful features of OpenHoldem is its ability to remember. Very few other bots have this ability. 
</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--1"></a>Planning 
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Working with memory symbols requires a bit of planning and specifically one should keep the following in mind: OpenHoldem does not know your memory symbol before you create it. This sounds simple but one should not forget it because it could create problems with your first hand (The symbol would be undefined and return 0). Once a memory symbol is created, and a value is stored, OpenHoldem will remember that value until it is altered or replaced by another or until OpenHoldem is closed. This is great if you want OpenHoldem to remember what happened 10 hands ago but could bite you if you forget to reset them. It is of utmost importance to decide when and what should be remembered. 
</div>
<h2 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2"></a>Formulation 
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
OpenHoldem provides memory_symbols to store values in variables in your formulas as a replacement for left-hand-side-expressions. Storing a value looks like me_st_SYMBOLNAME_VALUE. For example you can store:
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">numbers,</span> e.g. me_st_Pi_3_141
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">symbols,</span> e.g. me_st_MyChair_userchair 
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">functions,</span> e.g. me_st_CallFunction_f$call 
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">memory</span> symbols, e.g. me_st_OldValue_me_re_CurrentValue
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
me_st_ will store a new value, where_as me_re_ will lookup a previously stored value and me_inc_ will increment a value that serves as a counter. OpenHoldem memory-symbols will never reset as long as you don’t explicitly do so. Don’t confuse this behaviour with OpenPPL that resets all user-variables at the beginning of a new hand. A technical note: the desired result of a me_st_command is its side-effect; the symbol itself will be evaluated as 0.
</div>
<h2 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-3"></a>Ini-functions
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
All memory-symbols have to be cleared or initialized at some time. To do this in a clean and fail-safe way OpenHoldem provides six initialization-functions since version 4.2.0. They get called at various times of execution, but always after the basic symbols have been calculated and before the autoplayer-functions get evaluated. Due to our verbosity-fetish they should be pretty self-explaning:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
f$ini_function_on_startup
</li>
<li>
f$ini_function_on_connection
</li>
<li>
f$ini_function_on_handreset
</li>
<li>
f$ini_function_on_new_round
</li>
<li>
f$ini_function_on_my_turn
</li>
<li>
f$ini_function_on_heartbeat
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Simple example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$ini_function_on_my_turn##
f$MonsterHand ? me_st_GoodSlowPlaySituation_1 : 0
</pre>
</div>

<h2 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-4"></a>Putting it together
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
To make things clear we will be putting two memory symbols into your bot. A) We will create a “Stack to Pot Ratio” memory symbol (the function of this symbol is to store the ratio of our balance to the pot at the start of the betting on the flop to be retrieve later in order to make commitment decisions), and B) We will create a “Slow Play” memory symbol, (the function of this symbol is to store our decision during a betting round that we will check-raise the next betting round regardless of what the next card is)
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1"></a>STEP 1: Create the symbols:
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
In f$ini_function_on_handreset we put:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">  me_st_stpr_0 
+ me_st_slowplay_0
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
to reset these two values on handreset to zero (which means false in the second case).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2"></a>STEP 2 (a): 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
In f$ini_function_on_my_turn we put 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">betround == 2 ?
(me_st_stpr_f$stpr + me_st_slowplay_f$slowplay) : 0
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Id it is on the flop then we will store the values of the functions f$stpr and f$slowplay at that moment. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3"></a>STEP 2(b) 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
We create the functions whose value we want to store: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$stpr## 
balance/potcommon 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Comment: we don’t use “pot” because that would include any bets during round2 before us. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$slowplay##
betround==2 &amp;&amp; nhandshi==0 ? 1 : 0 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Comment: this formula will return 1 when we have the nuts and this will be stored into the “slowplay” memory symbol 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4"></a>STEP 3 Retrieve and use the memory. 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
In f$alli we put 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">betround==3 &amp;&amp; me_re_slowplay &amp;&amp; me_re_stpr&lt;10 ? 1 : 0 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
English translation: It is the turn and we, on the flop, decided to slow play and the ratio between the pot (at the start of betround==2) and our balance at that time was 1:10 and therefore we will shove. 
</div>
<h2 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-5"></a>Conclusion 
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The memory symbols are very powerful but need a bit of planning. It is important to decide when to define, store and retrieve the values in these symbols.
