In the OpenHoldem directoryyou will find the following files and sub-directories
: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OpenHoldem.exe, ManualMode.exe, OHReplay.exe, Rebuy.exe --- these are the main
 files for each of the programs in the OpenHoldem project.
 Details on how to use each of these are throughout this manual.

versus.bin
\end_layout

\end_inset

versus.bin --- this optional file is a large lookup table that is used by
 the versus symbols.
 As the versus database is quite large and does not change it is not included
 in the archives with recent executables.
 It is available at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

penHoldem_2007-10-13.rar?raw=true
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and should be extracted to the OpenHoldem directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A file with .ini extensions --- this is the configuration file with your
 preferred settings; OpenHoldem won't store any information in the registry
 but use an ini-file instead; it can be named whatever you like, OpenHoldem
 will use it automatically, as long as there is only one ini-file in the
 directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OpenHoldem_Manual.chm --- this manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OpenPPL_Manual.chm --- the OpenPPL manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
pokertracker_query_definitions.dll --- a small DLL that contains the queries
 for all PokerTracker-symbols.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
symbols_pokertracker.pdf --- a short PDF-guide to the PokerTracker-symbols.
 This is a separate document, because the concept of query-definitions in
 a PokerTracker-DLL allows regular updates and fast additions of new PokerTracke
r-symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OpenPPL_Library.ohf --- a plain-text library that contains the definition
 of several 100 poker-logical symbols like StartingStacksize, NumberOfRaisesOnTu
rn, HadTopPairOnFlop, Position, etc.
 The OpenPPL-library will be loaded silently in the background and all symbols
 are automatically available both for OpenPPL and OH-script-users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
dbghelp.dll
\end_layout

\end_inset

dbghelp.dll --- this is a Microsoft file that is used to produce memory dumps
 on critical errors.
 These memory dumps are useful for the developers to diagnose issues.
 
\end_layout

mouse.dll, 
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
scraper.dll
\end_layout

\end_inset

scraper.dll, user.dll --- these files are all extensions to OpenHoldem that
 you can use to customize the software.
 More detail on all of these are provided in this document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
*.lib-files -- these are linker files, necessary to link executables and
 DLLs against each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files with .pdb extensions --- these files contain the debug symbols that
 are required if you want to diagnose crashes or simply trace execution
 in a debugger.
 These files are usually not distributed with the executables as most end-users
 don't need them and the people who want to debug OpenHoldem are usually
 able to create debug-executables on their own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Documents-directory -- this directory contains useful information like the
 release-notes that document changes and the license-information (GPL v3).
 Feel free to peruse these if you have problems falling asleep some night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Logs -- this directory contains the log-files of the OpenHoldem bots.
 The logs are named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh_0.log
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ..
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh_24.log
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The log-files provide very useful information if you want to track down
 mis-plays or even bugs.
 To get the correct file for a certain instance of OpenHoldem you can also
 use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Menu -> Edit -> View Log File
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and OpenHoldem will open a text-editor with the correct log.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hand_Histories --- this directory contains auto-generated hand-histories
 for poker-sites that don't store hand-histories at your hard-drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scraper -- this directory contains the tablemaps for your favourite casinos.
 Just add your new tablemaps there once they have been tested; OpenHoldem
 will then load these tablemaps, so that its auto-connector will be able
 to connect out-of-the box to any open table and start playing.
