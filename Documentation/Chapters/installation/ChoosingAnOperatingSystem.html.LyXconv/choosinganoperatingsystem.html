</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
OpenHoldem has been originally designed to work best on the 32-bit versions of Microsoft’s Windows 2000 or Windows XP operating systems. Any service pack level on these two choices seems to be fine.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
OpenHoldem works at any later version of Windows too, but we recommend you avoid <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-Vista-0" href="#index-Windows-Vista">↓</a>Vista or its dependents (<a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-7-0" href="#index-Windows-7">↓</a>Windows 7, etc). These operating systems add a lot of useless cruft and bloatware that is not useful in this hobby. Most of the poker botters you will interact with in the community use Windows 2000 or Windows XP as well, so as you learn and exchange ideas, it is useful to be on the same platform. This is especially true of Table Maps. A TableMap designed for <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-XP-0" href="#index-Windows-XP">↓</a>Windows XP is not very likely to work on Vista.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Finally, as you scale your botting operation up, you want to keep things as lightweight as possible to best utilize the limited computing resources at your disposal. For this reason, <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-2000-0" href="#index-Windows-2000">↓</a>Windows 2000 or a minimalistic installation of Windows XP is often the choice of poker botters due to its very lean profile.
