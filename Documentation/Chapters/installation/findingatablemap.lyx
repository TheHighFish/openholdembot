Table Map 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The “scraper” directory should be where your Table Map files are stored.
 Table maps provide the OpenHoldem game state engine the instructions for
 deriving the state of the game from the pixels on the screen.
 These files have the “.tm” extension on them.
 The challenge with table maps is that every casino needs its own map.
 In some cases, you might need different maps for different game flavors.
 NL vs.
 FL, SNG vs.
 Ring, 10-seat vs.
 Heads-Up, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OpenHoldem project team does not provide official Table Maps for any
 casino or any Texas Hold’em game flavor.
 The reason for this is that there are thousands of casinos out there, and
 tens- or hundreds- of thousands of map combinations when you consider the
 different game flavors.
 Adding to that is the fact that casinos sometimes update their client software
 and make minor or comprehensive changes to the pixels as they are displayed
 on the screen.
 These changes most often require changes to the table map as well.
 The OpenHoldem Project development team is a group of volunteers --- we
 do not get paid for this, we have real lives and real families, and do
 this as a hobby.
 Maintaining working Table Maps would be a more than full time job, and
 thus instead we put the power in your hands; we provide Table Map creation
 tools and testing tools to allow you to be self-sufficient.
 An explanation of the “OpenScrape” program, which is key to this self-sufficien
cy, will be provided in more detail later in this document.
\end_layout

That said, there are a number of places you can find pre-created maps for
 use with OpenHoldem.
 There is a section on our forums (

\end_layout

\end_inset

) that contains several dozen user-contributed maps.
 Some of these maps might be out of date or require special system settings.
 So they at least require some validation to ensure they are 100% correct
 before you can take them to the tables.
 Consider these maps to be a starting point for learning how maps are constructe
d and how they work.

Most probably you will experience some problems if you fix or create your
 first map.

Offline simulators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we can't provide and maintain tablemaps for all casinos out there
 OpenHoldem comes with a set of tablemaps for some offline simulators.
 They are an easy starting point for every newbie and a good tool for experience
d users to develop and test bot-logic offline.
 OpenHoldem ManualMode seems to work out of the box at every system, but
 some of the others need special settings: e.g.
 window size or screen resolution.
