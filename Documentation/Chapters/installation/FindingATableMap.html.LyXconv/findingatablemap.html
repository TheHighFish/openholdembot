The “scraper” directory should be where your Table Map files are stored. Table maps provide the OpenHoldem game state engine the instructions for deriving the state of the game from the pixels on the screen. These files have the “.tm” extension on them. The challenge with table maps is that every casino needs its own map. In some cases, you might need different maps for different game flavors. NL vs. FL, SNG vs. Ring, 10-seat vs. Heads-Up, for example.

The OpenHoldem project team does not provide official Table Maps for any casino or any Texas Hold’em game flavor. The reason for this is that there are thousands of casinos out there, and tens- or hundreds- of thousands of map combinations when you consider the different game flavors. Adding to that is the fact that casinos sometimes update their client software and make minor or comprehensive changes to the pixels as they are displayed on the screen. These changes most often require changes to the table map as well. The OpenHoldem Project development team is a group of volunteers — we do not get paid for this, we have real lives and real families, and do this as a hobby. Maintaining working Table Maps would be a more than full time job, and thus instead we put the power in your hands; we provide Table Map creation tools and testing tools to allow you to be self-sufficient. An explanation of the “OpenScrape” program, which is key to this self-sufficiency, will be provided in more detail later in this document.

That said, there are a number of places you can find pre-created maps for use with OpenHoldem. There is a section on our forums (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=280">http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=280</a>) that contains several dozen user-contributed maps. Some of these maps might be out of date or require special system settings. So they at least require some validation to ensure they are 100% correct before you can take them to the tables. Consider these maps to be a starting point for learning how maps are constructed and how they work.

Most probably you will experience some problems if you fix or create your first map. Feel welcome to ask for assistance in the OpenHoldem Tablemap School (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=117">http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=117</a>).

Although we can’t provide and maintain tablemaps for all casinos out there OpenHoldem comes with a set of tablemaps for some offline simulators. They are an easy starting point for every newbie and a good tool for experienced users to develop and test bot-logic offline. OpenHoldem ManualMode seems to work out of the box at every system, but some of the others need special settings: e.g. window size or screen resolution. Please see the <span class="versalitas">Readme</span> files for details.
