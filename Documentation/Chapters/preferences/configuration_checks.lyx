\begin_layout Section
Configuration Checks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem will check some parts of your system configuration automatically
 on start-up to avoid the most common and time-consuming mis-configurations.
 Some of them (like minimum colour-depth) will always be executed, other
 can be turned off, if you don't use certain features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure
wide false
sideways false

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Check Keyboard Settings: 
\emph default
this option will, check for an english keyboard layout.
 Keyboard settings affect especially the decimal point in numbers and therefore
 the scraper-engine and the auto-player.
 If you continue with incorrect settings, OpenHoldem may or may not work
 as expected.
 If you are an experienced user with a working setup you may turn this warning
 off, but if you encounter problems (especially with betsizing) or are a
 beginner, you should better get your keyboard layout configured the correct
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Check Window Theme Settings: 
\emph default
this option will check, if the windows theme is set to Windows Classic (Windows
 2000 style), as that is the recommended theme and many TableMaps are build
 using this configuration.
 If you know exactly, what you do and are able to adapt your TableMaps to
 other configurations, then you may turn this setting off.
 However --- be aware, that any fancy settings might possibly break the
 scraper and will reduce your possibility to exchange maps with other users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Check Font Smoothing Settings: 
\emph default
This option will check, if Font Smoothing is turned off, as recommended.
 Font Smoothing does display names and numbers slightly more eye-freindly
 for a human user, but it will render scraping more difficult.
 If you know exactly what you do you may again turn this option off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other Configuration Checks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem does execute various other configuration checks, but part of
 them can't be turned off, as they are mandatory settings and the other
 ones will be triggered automatically.

 library, which is required for Perl users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Correct installation of ActivePerl, if the user wants to load the Perl interpret
er.
