Your worst Enemy

\begin_layout Standard
In the next chapters we will talk about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

stealth

, hiding the fact that a bot plays at your account(s).
 For most newbies this means a sophisticated technical setup.
 But before we go into these technical details we should consider the real
 threats for your botting career.

The RoboStars Security Guard?

\begin_layout Standard
True, 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 casinos care about botters, some a bit more and some a bit less.
 But most casinos accept and even like botters, because they usually are
 good customers:

\begin_layout Itemize
botters provide traffic and playing opportunities for the recreational players
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they usually extract less money from the eco-system than a good winning
 player (these greedy evil 2+2 gangsters)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
some of the botters even bring money to the table.
 Consider all the stupid newbies wo buy a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

winning profile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from a questionable salesman and then take it to the NL 100 tables.
 There have been thousands of them in the past at various botting sites
 and forums.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the few long-term botters generate lots of rake for the casino, sometimes
 even more than their own winnings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they are handsome and don't cause much work for the support team: no questions
 and no problems (well, as long as the opponents don't complain...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some casinos like botters so much that they actively seek cooperation.
 We know at least one small italian gambling site that got in contact with
 a commercial poker bot seller.
 The forum owner was enthusiastic -- until it turned out that cashouts took
 at least six months -- if they appeared at all.
 The cooperation never happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
The Players at your Table?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Getting reported by your opponents is a serious threat.
 Then casinos have to react, no matter how much they like botters.
 Some casinos tried to reduce this risk and disabled support for tracking-softwa
re; others even invented anonymous tables to protect their fish -- and to
 protect their botters too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering these points it becomes obvious who is your worst opponent:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
You!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main threat for your botting-success is your own bot-like behaviour.
 In a certain botting-forum people advise to play 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not more than human-like 12-16 hours a day
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and newbies ask if they can play 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

human-like 18 hours
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 too.
 Others run multiple cashgame bots with exactly the same stats.
 Simply sorting your opponents by PokerTracker-stats will reveal everything.
 It is always the same story:
