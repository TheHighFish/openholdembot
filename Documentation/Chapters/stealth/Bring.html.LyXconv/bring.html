“Bring” (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.winholdem.net/bring/index.html">http://www.winholdem.net/bring/index.html</a>) is a software program developed by Ray Bornert. The sole purpose of Bring is to enable a dual-system configuration, and allow the casino’s poker windows from “System A” to be displayed on “System B” where OpenHoldem can connect to them.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1"></a>Step 1 — Install <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Bring-1" href="#index-Bring">↓</a>Bring on your virtual computer
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You now have a real computer and a virtual computer. OpenHoldem is going to run on the real computer. The casino software is going to run on the virtual computer. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now you need to install some software that will allow OpenHoldem (on the real computer) to see what the casino software (on the virtual computer) is doing. There are several ways of doing this. We are going to use a piece of software called "Bring". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the virtual computer, log in as the stealth user. Now go to the official WinHoldem site and download "bring.exe" (from the "stealth" page). Download it directly into the Ninja folder: <a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.winholdem.net/bring/">http://www.winholdem.net/bring/</a>. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The casino software can’t see inside the Ninja folder, but it will be able to see Bring being run as a process. (If you want to see all the processes your computer is running, press CTRL+ALT+DEL and then click on the "processes" tab.) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The solution is to rename Bring to something more innocent. Then, if the casino software looks at the processes you are running, it won’t be able to find out anything incriminating about Bring. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Rename Bring now. For example, you could rename it to "notepad" or “paint". 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2"></a>Step 2 — Install <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-software-0" href="#index-software">↓</a>software on your real computer
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You can now install Bring on your real computer. You don’t need to rename it; the casino cannot see what is happening on your real computer. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Open a folder on the desktop, call it "Bring", and download into it the files "bring.exe" and “bring.ini". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click "Start - Control Panel - Folder Options". Click the "View" tab. In the box labeled "Advanced Settings", scroll down and find the line "Hide extensions for known file types". If there is a green tick next to this line, click on it to make the tick disappear. Click "OK” to save your changes. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You should also install OpenHoldem on your real computer now if you haven’t already. <i>Do not install OpenHoldem on your virtual computer.</i>
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3"></a>Step 3 — Configure Bring 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Do you remember the IP address of your virtual computer? You’re going to need it again now. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On your real computer, go into the "Bring" folder you just created and open the file "bring.ini" in a text editor. (Right-click on “bring.ini”, choose "Open with..." and select "Notepad".) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Find the following lines: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing"># remotehost      port  password  
-------------------------------- 
a 192.168.x.x     ????  prompt 
b 192.168.x.x     ????  prompt 
--------------------------------
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Change them to this: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing"># remotehost      port  password  
-------------------------------- 
a x.x.x.x         eeee  secret
--------------------------------
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<ul>
<li>
x.x.x.x should be the IP address of your virtual computer. 
</li>
<li>
eeee is the "port" number. It can be a number of your own choice. 80 would be a good choice, and so would 800, 5000 or 8080. 
</li>
<li>
"secret" is a password. It’s not a good password, but it is fine for the purposes of testing Bring. 
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Here are the changes I made to my bring.ini file: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing"># remotehost port password
-------------------------------- 
a 192.168.1.7 80 secret 
-------------------------------- 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4"></a>Step 4 — Start Bring 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Now we’re going to test Bring by playing a game of solitaire on the virtual computer, and by attempting to control it from the real computer. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Go to the virtual computer. You should still be logged in as the stealth user. Start the Solitaire programme ("Start - All Programs - Games - Solitaire"). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now open another command prompt (click "Start - Run", type "cmd" and press enter). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The command prompt window is currently looking at the "My Documents" folder. You need to move into the Ninja folder. If you followed the earlier suggestion, the location of your Ninja folder will be "C:\files". To move into this folder, simply type “CD C:\files" and press return. (If this doesn’t work you will need to learn how to use the command prompt. Do an Internet search for "DOS command prompt".) 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now type the following command and press return. Instead of bring, you should type the name of your renamed file. Instead of 80, you should type the port number you chose in the previous step, and instead of "secret" you should type the password you chose. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">bring -s 80 secret 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
A small pop-up will appear to show you that Bring has started on your virtual computer. Click "OK". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now go to your real computer. Go into the Bring folder and double click on "bring.exe". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another pop-up appears to show you that Bring has started on your real computer. Click “OK”. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another window appears labeled "Select remote connection". You should see a line that looks exactly like the line you entered in the "bring.ini" file. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">a 192.168.1.7 80 secret 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Click on this line so that it turns blue, and click the "OK" button. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another window appears with a list of programs that are currently running on your virtual computer. One of them should be solitaire, so click on it so that it turns blue and then click the "OK" button. Solitaire will launch on your real computer, and if everything is set up correctly, you will be able to play it and watch your mouse clicks affecting both computers at once! 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you are unable to control solitaire from your real computer you definitely won’t be able to control a poker table. Before you continue, seek help from someone who understands networks. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-5"></a>Step 5 — Stop running Bring 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
When you have had enough of playing solitaire, you should shut down Bring. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the real computer, just close the solitaire window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the virtual computer, there are three ways to stop Bring. 
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Log off 
</li>
<li>
Stop the Bring process. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL. Two task manager windows will appear, one for the real computer and one for the virtual computer. Find the task manager on the virtual computer and click the "Processes" tab, find “bring.exe" (however you renamed it), click on it to turn it blue, and then click on "End Process". 
</li>
<li>
Lock the desktop. This doesn’t actually close Bring, but it does halt it and prevent your real computer from communicating with it. 
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
Stop Bring on both computers before you move on to the next step. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-6"></a>Step 6 — Set up the "run as a different user" facility 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
When you connect to the casino’s Internet site you should always be logged into your virtual computer as the casino user. However, you will be running Bring <i>as if</i> you will logged on as the stealth user. In this way, the casino won’t be able to detect that you are using Bring. Here’s how to do it. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the virtual computer, log in as the casino user. Right-click on the desktop and choose "New", then choose "Shortcut". A window will appear. In the box, type "cmd". Click "Next" and then click "Finish". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A new icon, “cmd.exe", will have appeared on your desktop. It’s actually a shortcut to the command prompt that you have used a few times before. Right-click on this shortcut and choose "Properties". A window appears and the "Shortcut" tab should already be showing. Click the "Advanced" button. Find the line which reads "Run with different credentials". Click on it so that a tick appears next to it. Click the "OK" buttons twice. "Run with different credentials" actually means "run this program as a different user". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Start solitaire again. Double click the “cmd.exe" shortcut and a window will appear, asking you which user you want to use to run the program. Click on the line "The following user". Then, enter the stealth user’s name and password, and click “OK". 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The command prompt window appears. It is running as if you were logged in as the stealth user. We can safely run Bring from this window. Go into the Ninja folder (perhaps by typing "CD C:\files”). Type the following command, changing the words "bring", "80" and "secret" exactly as you did in step 4. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">bring -s 80 secret 
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Bring’s pop-up window appears, so click the “OK” button. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now go to the real computer and start Bring there. Try to open the solitaire window, just as you did before. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Go back to the virtual computer. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to make the task manager appear in both windows. Find the virtual computer’s task manager and select the "Properties" tab. Check that "bring.exe" (however you renamed it) is running under the stealth user, even though you are logged in as the casino user. Check that "sol.exe" - the solitaire process - is running under the casino user. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7"></a>Step 7 — Check security with <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Gaze-0" href="#index-Gaze">↓</a>Gaze 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
We’re going to make one more security check using the program Gaze. It can be downloaded from the forums at the WinHoldem official site. (<a class="FlexURL" href="http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=1114">http://forum.winholdem.net/wbb/viewtopic.php?t=1114</a>)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Still on the virtual computer and still logged in as the casino user, go to the WinHoldem site. There should be two files - "gaze.cpp" and “gaze.exe". Download both of them to the virtual computer’s desktop. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Double click on “gaze.exe” to run it. A window will appear, and shortly afterwards a pop-up labeled "Windows - no disk" will appear. Click the "Cancel" button, and close the Gaze window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The results of the test have been saved to a file on the desktop called "gaze”. Confusingly, there are now two text files on the desktop with the same name. Double click one of them to open it in a text editor. If the first few lines don’t look like this, you’ve got the wrong file.

If you can see the message "OpenProcess failed with error 5 (Access is denied)", then you will know for sure that the casino user can’t find out anything incriminating about Bring. Your security checks are now complete. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Close Notepad, solitaire and the “cmd.exe" shortcut. Delete Gaze from your desktop and empty the recycle bin. Terminate the Bring process. Reboot the virtual computer.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-8"></a>Step 8 — Install the <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-casino-software-0" href="#index-casino-software">↓</a>casino software 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You can now install the casino software. On the virtual computer, log in as the casino user. Create a new folder on the desktop called "poker". It’s a good idea to install all your casino software in a single folder. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The casino user currently has restricted privileges. Some casinos insist that you install their software when logged in as a user with administrative privileges. Some casinos also insist that you run their software when logged in as a user with administrative privileges. Preferably, we would like to install and run the software while logged in as a user has restricted privileges. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Here is how to set up a typical casino’s poker software. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Still logged in as the casino user, go to the casino web site. Download their software directly into the poker folder you created moments ago. Go into the folder and double click on the software. It will begin installing. When the install asks where you would like to install the software, choose the "poker" folder you created moments ago. Don’t let the install the use the default folder. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If the installation completes without complaints, all is well. However, if the installation complaints that it needs administrative privileges, this is what you must do: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Log out from the casino user’s account and log in to the admin user’s account. Open the "User Accounts" window just as you did before. Click on the casino user act and then click on "Change the account type". Click on "Computer Administrator" and then click the "Change Account Type" button. Log out from the admin user’s account and log back into the casino user’s account. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Try to install the software again. This time it should install without complaints. Now log out of the casino user’s account and go back to the admin user account. Change the casino user’s account type back to "limited". Log out of the admin user account and log back into the casino user’s account. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now try running the software. If the software complaints that it needs administrative privileges to run, change the casino user’s account to "Computer Administrator" just as you did above. It’s unfortunate that you have to run the software with administrative privileges, but it’s not the end of the world.

OpenHoldem is quite fussy about which desktop theme you are using. Currently, only the <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-XP-0" href="#index-Windows-XP">↓</a>Windows XP default style and the <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-Windows-2000-0" href="#index-Windows-2000">↓</a>Windows 2000 <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-classic-style-0" href="#index-classic-style">↓</a>classic style are supported.
