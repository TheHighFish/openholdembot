In the next chapters we will talk about &ldquo;stealth&rdquo;, hiding the fact that a bot plays at your account(s). For most newbies this means a sophisticated technical setup. But before we go into these technical details we should consider the real threats for your botting career.

True, <i>some</i> casinos care about botters, some a bit more and some a bit less. But most casinos accept and even like botters, because they usually are good customers:

<ul>
<li>
botters provide traffic and playing opportunities for the recreational players
</li>
<li>
they usually extract less money from the eco-system than a good winning player (these greedy evil 2+2 gangsters)
</li>
<li>
some of the botters even bring money to the table. Consider all the stupid newbies wo buy a &ldquo;winning profile&rdquo; from a questionable salesman and then take it to the NL 100 tables. There have been thousands of them in the past at various botting sites and forums.
</li>
<li>
the few long-term botters generate lots of rake for the casino, sometimes even more than their own winnings
</li>
<li>
they are handsome and don’t cause much work for the support team: no questions and no problems (well, as long as the opponents don’t complain...)
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Some casinos like botters so much that they actively seek cooperation. We know at least one small italian gambling site that got in contact with a commercial poker bot seller. The forum owner was enthusiastic — until it turned out that cashouts took at least six months — if they appeared at all. The cooperation never happened.

Getting reported by your opponents is a serious threat. Then casinos have to react, no matter how much they like botters. Some casinos tried to reduce this risk and disabled support for tracking-software; others even invented anonymous tables to protect their fish — and to protect their botters too.

Considering these points it becomes obvious who is your worst opponent:

The main threat for your botting-success is your own bot-like behaviour. In a certain botting-forum people advise to play &ldquo;not more than human-like 12-16 hours a day&rdquo; and newbies ask if they can play &ldquo;human-like 18 hours&rdquo; too. Others run multiple cashgame bots with exactly the same stats. Simply sorting your opponents by PokerTracker-stats will reveal everything. It is always the same story:
