</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
An important consideration for any botter is that of stealth. Many casinos will attempt to detect the OpenHoldem software on your computer and will either warn you or seize your account’s funds if they find it. There are two general approaches to addressing this problem, a <i>Single System</i> solution and a <i>Dual System</i> solution. OpenHoldem provides a number of facilities for achieving both of these setups and obscuring the program from detection.

Note that a “System” as discussed in this chapter can refer to a physical machine or a virtual machine. VMware Workstation is a popular choice for consumer system virtualization, but certainly you can make use of the other consumer virtualization products available, such as VirutalPC or VirtualBox. Addtionally, data center-class, bare metal hypervisor products such as VMWare ESX or Citrix XEN will work fine as well. See the VMWare section for information on configuring VMWare Workstation. Configuration of other virtualization platforms is not discussed in this documentation.
