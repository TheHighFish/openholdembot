<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Not all symbols are equally reliable. Some may be very sensitive to temporary
occlusion, whereas others may give counter-intutive results to the beginner.
Below is a list of the most common pitfalls and misunderstandings regarding
the OpenHoldem symbols. There are for sure others, and maybe we are not
even aware of them, as the issues are too obvious and natural for experienced
users.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   Whenever there are unclear questions regarding some symbols, ManualMode and the
debug-tab will give you quick answers in a reliable and reproducable way. If you have
further questions or if the results at ManualMode seem to be wrong, feel free to ask at
the forums and provide some screenshots for explanantion.
           <ul class="itemize1">
        <li class="itemize">Not  all  symbols  are  equally  reliable.  Some  symbols  do  rely  only  on
        the  current  state  (e.g.  stacks  and  bets),  some  require  the  complete
        game-history  (e.g.  nbetsroundX).  All  symbols  which  rely  on  history
        are  especially  volatile  against  (incorrect)  hand-resets  and  temporary
        occlusion. That is no bug, but simply inevitable. It is the users duty to
        care about a stable environment and choose a proper handreset-method
        for the tablemap.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Autoplayer-symbols (e.g. didcallroundX) mean: what the autoplayer did,
        not what happened in the game. If you connect in the middle of a game,
        if you interact manually or if you connect multiple bots to the same table,
        then these symbols will return unexpected results. It may also sometimes
        (very rarely) happen, that the autoplayer attempts to act, but that the
        action fails for whatever reason and has no effect. If you need failsafe code,
        you should check a combination of various symbols (e.g. bets and balances
        in combination with autoplayer-symbols).
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Some symbols like nplayersdealt have been very sensitive to fast folds
        in early position, as there is no guarantee, that we catch every single
        game-state and every single event. The &#8220;obvious&#8221; workaround was to use
        nchairsdeltleft and nchairsdealtright to determine the position relative to
        the dealer. But as too many newbies have been overburdened by such
        subtleties we do now consider players as &#8220;dealt&#8221;, when they are posting
        blinds. This may very rarely give incorrect results, but is far better than
        the old approach.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">Detecting blinds correctly from screenshots is a nearly impossible task,
        if you want to consider all possible cases (missing small blind; additional
        blinds; players posting blinds + dead; games with antes; distinguishing
        blinds in early position from open-limpers; players sitting in again without
        having to post a blind and limping; players being allin for the blind or
        less; reversed blinds for most heads-up games; 3-handed-games becoming
        headsup; etc.). Therefore OH does mostly assume, that there are exactly
        two blinds present in the game.
           </li>
        <li class="itemize">If there are multiple ways to make the same hand (e.g. KT on a board of

        9TJQ2) OpenHoldem will first use your hole-cards, then the board-cards.
        In the example above it will use both cards for the straight (npcbits =
        2), though one of the cards is on the board, too. Both ways have its pros
        and cons, but this one is the official way, as it is backward compatible to
        WinHoldem.</li></ul>
