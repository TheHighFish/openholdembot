What is OpenHoldem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem (and its supporting applications: OpenScrape, ManualMode and
 OHReplay) is an open source screen scraping framework and programmable
 logic engine for the online Texas Hold'em style poker game.
  This framework provides the capabilities to allow you to build your own
 Texas Hold'em robot (bot).
 There are two major parts to any poker bot: the game state engine and the
 action engine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of approaches for getting the game state from a poker
 client, including directly reading the memory of the poker software, injecting
 code into the client's address space, parsing the client's chat box, and
 interpreting the pixels presented on the screen by the client.
  OpenHoldem's game state engine uses the last approach -- it provides a
 parameter driven method of interpreting the pixels ("

) presented by the poker client to determine the state of the game at any
 given time.
  Screen scraping is not a new approach to this kind of problem, poker botting
 or otherwise.
 Screen scraping has been a recognized approach for solving a specific set
 of computer problems almost since computers were invented.
  Screen scraping has been around for a longer period of time than most
 of you reading this have been alive! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action engine in OpenHoldem is called the 
\emph on
Autoplayer
\emph default
.
  The Autoplayer will use logic that is provided by you to decide what poker
 action to take based on the current game state.
  The Autoplayer will then click the buttons and enter the text on the screen
 to make the poker client execute this action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem is a framework.
  What that means is that you need to provide it with a couple of things
 to enable the game state engine and the action engine to operate correctly.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first is the parameters that instruct OpenHoldem how to interpret the
 pixels presented by the casino that you play at.
  Each casino presents these pixels in a slightly different manner, and
 thus these parameters need to be specific for each casino.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second is the logic to tell the action engine what to do -- just like every
 person plays live/human poker in a different style, this logic will instruct
 OpenHoldem how to play the style that you want it to play.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem supports every casino in existence today, as far as we know.
  If you find a casino that does not work with OpenHoldem's game state or
 action model, please hit the forums and let us know.
  The developer team is very responsive to modifying OpenHoldem to work
 with the continually changing landscape of Texas Hold'em casino client
 software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem also supports every sub-flavor of Texas Hold'em poker known to
 exist today.
  No-limit, fixed-limit, pot-limit, full ring, heads-up, 6-max, MTT, SNG,
 double or nothing, turbo, normal speed, whatever.
 Someone else has already made it work -- you can make it work too.
