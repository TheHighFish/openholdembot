What OpenHoldem is not
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem is not a complete poker bot.
  There is much work you need to do to utilize the framework effectively,
 however this manual and the community on the forums can help you to do
 so.
  If you truly desire a poker bot that includes logic written by someone
 else, a quick Google search will turn up a number of likely candidates.
  Be aware, however, that a pre-packaged, complete, click-Setup.exe-and-go,
 poker bot is not a good way to be successful.
  Consistent and trusted positive results from these pre-packaged bots are
 impossible to find.
  If pre-packaged bots really worked, if we could have spent $20 to make
 $1000's, we certainly would have bought one ourselves, rather than spending
 the thousands of hours to create this framework!

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem does not allow for automated collusion.
 Poker botting currently is in a gray area of legality and morality, with
 many strong perspectives on both sides of the argument.
  The OpenHoldem development team strongly believes that automated collusion
 is clearly illegal and immoral, and will not provide the facility to help
 you achieve these ends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenHoldem is not a general-purpose poker botting engine for all styles
 of poker.
  It was intentionally suited only to the "Texas Hold'em" flavor of poker
 favored by the majority of online players today, and at present it supports

 also.
 But don't ask if it supports Stud or Razz --- it does not.
