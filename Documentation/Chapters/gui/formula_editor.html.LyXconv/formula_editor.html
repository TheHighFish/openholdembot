<div class="Indented">
The large control on the right side of the window displays the code for whatever function you have currently selected in the tree on the left. Primary FunctionsFunction Description 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1"></a>f$allin
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This function instructs the Autoplayer to move all-in, either with the slider, or by entering the bet into the SWAG box, depending on the parameters in the Table Map.  If this function evaluates to a non-zero result, and an appropriate control is present on the table (slider, swag field), then the Autoplayer will move all in.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection--1"></a>f$swag
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This function instructs the Autoplayer to place a stated wager (SWAG) by entering the bet into the SWAG box.  If this function evaluates to a non-zero result, and the SWAG box is present on the table, then the Autoplayer will enter the results of f$swag into the SWAG box and confirm the bet.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2"></a>f$raise
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This function instructs the Autoplayer to raise.  If this function evaluates to a non-zero result, and the raise button is present on the table, then the Autoplayer will click the raise button.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3"></a>f$call
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This function instructs the Autoplayer to call.  If this function evaluates to a non-zero result, and the call button is present on the table, then the Autoplayer will click the call button.Secondary FunctionsThe following table describes the secondary functions.  These are secondary, because they do not directly instruct the Autoplayer to take action, but rather are used indirectly to determine the action, some of which are not the traditional poker actions of all-in, raising, checking, calling or folding.Function Description 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4"></a>f$P
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This function is intended to evaluate to the number of opponents that should be simulated when OpenHoldem calculates various symbols.The symbols influenced by this function are those calculated by the Iterator (see {The Iterator} section}, prwin, prlos, and prtie, and also by the symbols prwinnow, prlosnow, and handrankp.The f$P value is important to these symbols because it determines how many opposing hands are simulated. The f$P value will radically affect the values of these symbols.  For example, the higher the f$P value the more opponent hands will be simulated and your win probability will be lower. Similarly, the lower the f$P value the less opponent hands will be simulated and your win probability will be higher.  For instance, AA against 9 opponents (f$P==9) has about a 30% chance of winning, assuming every hand stays for the showdown (no-foldem).  AA against 1 opponent (P=1) has about an 80% chance of winning.  The possible values for f$P are 0 to 22, both inclusive. If f$P exceeds 22, it will be set to 22, as 22 is the maximum number of players our imaginary HoldEm table would be able to play (22 opponents * 2 cards = 44 cards, my two cards, the 5 common cards).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-5"></a>f$srai
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This function is a support function for f$swag.  The intent is that f$srai specifies the amount to raise above the current bet, and that f$swag then further adjusts that based on the style that the individual casino uses to post SWAG bets.  Here is an example of a vanilla f$swag function that calls f$srai:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$swag##
f$srai&gt;0 ? ((((f$swag_adjust + f$srai)/sblind)+.5)^0)*sblind : 0
​
##f$swag_adjust##
swagtextmethod == 3 ? (call + currentbet) : 
swagtextmethod == 2 ? (call) : 
0
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that this f$swag also rounds your bet to the nearest sblind.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-6"></a>f$prefold
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If this function evaluates to non-zero, and a pre-fold button is visible on the poker table window (as defined in the Table Map), then OpenHoldem will engage that pre-fold button as soon as it can (which may be before it is your turn to act). A good example of a f$prefold function might be the following:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$prefold##
br==1 
&amp;&amp; nplayersdealt&gt;4 
&amp;&amp; handrank2652&gt;2652*0.66 
&amp;&amp; !currentbet &amp;&amp; !f$swag &amp;&amp;!!!??? &amp;&amp; !f$raise &amp;&amp; !f$call
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7"></a>f$delay
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The function controls how long to delay, once the specified number of stable frames have been seen (see {Preferences} section}, to take a poker action. The function evaluates to the delay time in milliseconds.An example of this might be:
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-8"></a>f$chat
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
f$playThis function controls how the Autoplayer interacts with the sitin, sitout, and leave buttons as defined in the Table Map. The possible values that this function can return are explicit and limited.  Any other return values are ignored. The allow return values and their meaning are: -2, Leave table -1, No change (if you are sitting out, stay out, if sitting in stay that way) 0, Sit out 1, Sit in/Stay inf$evraisf$evcallHelper FunctionsThe following table describes the helper functions.  These are not used by the Autoplayer.Function Description

<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-9"></a>Notes
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This is a free form function for you to use as you please.  This is typically used for usage instructions and version notes.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-10"></a>dll
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Contains a filename or path to a DLL to load by default. For example: my_user_dll.dll
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-11"></a>f$test
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This function is intended to be used to test expressions. Whatever is typed in here gets calculated as a whole when the "Calc" button is clicked. f$test can be referenced from other formulas, although that is not recommended, as f$test is really intended as a development/debugging aid. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-12"></a>f$debug
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The debug function operates differently than the other function. Its purpose is to allow for arbitrary expressions to be evaluated and the results of those expressions to be displayed. To add a new expression add a new line with an equal sign, followed by the expression. For example: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">= 2+2
= f$UserDefinedFormula
= nopponents
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
In order for the results to be displayed you must either press the ’Calc’ or ’Auto’ button. The ’Auto’ button will recalculate the debug formula once each heartbeat. For example: 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">4 = 2+2
1 = f$UserDefinedFormula
6 = nopponents
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
If an expression is invalid it will be reported where the result would normally be found.
