<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--1"></a>What Is (Open)PPL?
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
PPL is an acronym for<i> Poker Programming Language</i>, a language to program poker bots. It was invented by <a class="URL" href="www.bonusbots.com">Shanky BonusBots</a> to ease the customization of their proprietary bot-logic.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One day an unnamed hero decided to give away his &ldquo;80% working translator&rdquo; to the OpenHoldem community. So OpenPPL was born and after a long period of development OpenPPL finally got completely integrated into OpenHoldem. Whereas the first version of OpenPPL needed to be translated to OH-script, OpenHoldem does now natively support plain-text OpenPPL without any translation steps. So OpenPPL now combines the best of both worlds even better: easiness of programming and mighty potential at the tables.

<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--2"></a>The Advantage Of OpenPPL
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Of course OpenPPL supports the main features of PPL, especially:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
an easy English-like programming language, that can be learned in no time.
</li>
<li>
a library of several hundred ready-to-use functions for an easy start.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Besides that OpenHoldem &amp; OpenPPL provide some additional cool functionality that you might have missed if you have used other bots in the past:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
knowing the stacksize of every single player.
</li>
<li>
the ability to play at any casino you want, provided you create a tablemap for it.
</li>
<li>
the ability to develop and debug your bot with tools like ManualMode, PokerAcademy and PokerTH. Did you ever want to simulate A2o at the button or a flushdraw out of position several dozen times until you are satisfied?
</li>
<li>
an auto-connector, that handles up to 25 tables at once with less than 1% CPU-overhead. All you have to do: open a table and sit-down. OpenHoldem connects automatically (one instance per table) and starts to play.
</li>
<li>
ability to use Poker Tracker stats directly in your OpenPPL-code.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
But if you are an expert you might want to make use of some advanced features:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
building symbols on your own.
</li>
<li>
accessing Openholdem’s native symbols and doing hand-range calculations on the fly.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
And the best of all: 
</div>
<ul>
<li>
you can contribute to the project to make it even better.
</li>
<li>
it’s all for free. Well - nearly free; of course it requires a bit of learning and some work to become a master.
</li>

</ul>
