</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Most people in the OpenHoldem world create their profile(s) completely from scratch. However the users with Shanky-BonusBots experience know a different approach: take an existing (demo-) bot and tweak it. Tweaking OpenPPL-profiles is relative easy, especially if they are written the simple way, everything in four large functions (f$preflop, f$flop, f$turn and f$river). OpenPPL evaluates from top to bottom of a function. So if you are not happy with the play in a certain situation the solution is easy: create a rule (exception) and put it on top of everything so that it overrides the current code. Higher position — higher priority.

<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--1"></a>Why &ldquo;WHEN Others&rdquo;?
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Tweaking this way is easy. Now there is just one little technical pitfall. The profile to be tweaked might contain some one-line-statements at the top that always got executed. Now if you add your code on top of that profile the former one-line-statements would be bound to the last potential open-ended when-condition in your code. They would now only get executed if that open-ended when-condition was true. Therefore you have to terminate your last open-ended when-condition and start a new one that is always true:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN  Others   // Always true
   // former one-line-statements here
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Now the former one-line-statements are guaranteed to get executed always again, independent of any conditions in your code.

<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--2"></a>Combining multiple Profiles
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Of course it is possible to combine multiple profiles:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
a complete profile that plays somewhat reasonable on bottom to cover all situations.
</li>
<li>
a tweaking, incomplete profile on top of it to fix the largest holes.
</li>
<li>
finally your own tweaking code on the very top of everything for the fine-tuning.
</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--3"></a>The final Action
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Complete profiles usually end with the code
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN Others
   WHEN Others Fold FORCE
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
This code first terminates the last open-ended when-condition and then folds everything. If your favourite demo-bot misses such a statement this is a clear sign that this profile is incomplete, i.e it is a tweak for some other profile. In this case it usually needs some code for completion; however if you are happy with it you can use this profile as is. Whenever OpenHoldem reaches the end of a function it will evaluate the end as zero / false / fold and take the action accordingly.

   ...
