<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Back in the days when Ms Bunnybaker won an online-ticket to one of the main poker
events online-poker became very popular; lots of brick-and-mortar-players joined
the online-tables. A visionary named Ray E. Bornert created the WinHoldem
pokerbotting-framework for the fixed-limit games. A guy called Winngy used it to build
his first poker-bot. It played the so called low-stakes up to $10/$20 (big blind and big
bet, not buyins). Casinos offered the same limits like real casinos these days; and all
revreational players used to choose the same limits they were used to from their local
casino.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   So Winngy enjoyed a nice win-rate and at a new online-casino an equally nice
prop-deal of 120% rakeback for a player who always hangs around in order to get the
games started. Unfortunately for Winngy the fixed-limit games were drying up and
bacame less popular due to a company named PokerTragedy and their Chinese
rakeback-slaves. So Winngy counted his winnings and moved on to other game-types. As
a true gentleman he donated his pokerbot to the OpenHoldem community for learning
and tweaking.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Termita SNG</h3>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >One day our member TheHighFish out of curiousity had a look at some Shanky
demobots and came across a very special one. It was a SNG-bot written by Tetre and
Xiquetete, our member Termitapalahermita. THF immediately recognized its potential.
The bot-logic was nicely written and well structured. It used dozens of user-variables
in order to avoid code-clones and achieve a readable, sel-documenting code.
Furthermore it could be configured to play various types of SNGs nearly out of the
box.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   So THF asked the sole creator who was left, Termita, for allowance to include this
bot as a default-bot for OpenHoldem. Termita agreed and so THF started to
work, rewriting the entire bot. OpenHoldem symbols like StartingStackSize,
StartingBigBlindSize and maxnplayersdealt made it possivle to get rid of the
configuration section and detect the game-type automatically, be it 6-max, 9-max,
10-max, deep-stack, normal, turbo or hyper-turbo.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   When THF ran out of time and money Trish took over, a lady who plays poker since
the shooting of Kennedy. She finished the work, fine-tuned ranges, added some
headsup-code and a little bit more aggression. Postflop was said to be based on a mixture
of Doodle and Zulu, so it got completely removed in favour of roller-coaster
Gecko.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   Then we stepped a little bit back, looked at our work with pride and decided that it
was a wonderful starting-point for every SNG-botter.
