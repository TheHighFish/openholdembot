<a class="toc" name="toc-Chapter--1"></a>Differences To Shanky And Old-Style-PPL
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
If you are a botter who used Shanky-PPL in the past there are some differences you should know about:
</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--1"></a>Plain Text Only
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The deciphering of encypted PPL is a business-secret of Shanky BonusBots. We don’t know and will never support this data-format. Our aim is to build an open-source botting-tool and not a marketing-platform for shady salesmen. Therefore OpenPPL is plain text only — for profiles you own legally, or even better: for profiles you build on your own.
</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--2"></a>No Option Settings
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Standard Shanky-PPL supports option settings to configure their built-in-default bot; at least that was the old way to do so, but nowadays most of these settings get overwritten by the profile and have no effect at all. OpenHoldems built-in Gecko-bot does not support any Shanky-opttions; they have no effect and simply get ignored.<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">MakePotSizedPreFlopRaisesWhen = 6
FoldToPre-FlopRaisesForAQAJsKQ = OFF
FoldPost-FlopBelowTopPairToAnyBetOrRaise = OFF
FoldToPost-FlopRaisesWithUnpairedBoardsFor = 2 
...
custom
​
preflop
...
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<h2 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1"></a>No Keyword Custom
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
As no built-in default bot exists the whole bot-logic is &ldquo;custom&rdquo;. Sure, we could ignore that superfluous keyword, however it is an indication of old-style or Shanky-style (Open)PPL. There will be more things &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; for sure, so we prefer to show you a warning as early as possible.
</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--3"></a>Preflop, Flop, Turn and River Sections
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The four main code-sections are functions (technically speaking), therefore they have OH-script-style function-header-syntax:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$preflop##
    WHEN ... RaiseMax FORCE
    ...
​
##f$flop##
​
##f$turn##
​
##f$river##
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
At least the f$preflop-section must be present for OpenHoldem to switch to OpenPPL-mode.
</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--4"></a>Floating Point Numbers
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
There are some differences between Standard PPL and OpenPPL you should care about — luckily only very few:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Standard PPL uses integers everywhere, whereas OpenPPL uses floating point numbers. An example: in Standard PPL you could write code like:<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN Stacksize = 1 AND ... RaiseBy 1 FORCE
WHEN Stacksize = 2 AND
</pre>
</div>
or even<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN AmountToCall = 70% Stacksize
</pre>
</div>
which will cause troubles with OpenHoldem, because OpenHolden uses real numbers like 31.41. Therefore it is recommended to use inequality-operators, for example like below: <div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN Stacksize &lt; 1.5 AND ... RaiseBy 1 FORCE
WHEN Stacksize &lt; 2.5 AND
</pre>
</div>
Or you could even use the new approximately-equal-operator:<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN Stacksize ~~ 3 RaiseMax FORCE
</pre>
</div>

</li>
<li>
Standard PPL’s symbol NutFullHouseOrFourOfAKind uses lower numbers for better full houses or quads, but 0 for no full house at all. This is somewhat inconsistent and OpenPPL uses a high number (999) for that case.
</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--5"></a>Hand And Board Expressions
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
OpenHoldem’s formula engine uses floating-point-numbers internally and there is no easy way to represent a board of cards as a single floating-point-number. There could even be various different board-expressions at the right side of an equality comparator that are all true.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN Board = AT ...
WHEN Board = ATSuited...
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Therefore we don’t support native Shanky-syntax here but use parameterized symbols
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN board$AT ...
WHEN board$ATSuited ...
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--6"></a>Cases Matter (Partially)
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
OpenHoldem is case-sensitive — contrary to standard PPL. Therefore the case used (upper and/or lower) matters. The rules for your OpenPPL code are more user-friendly and less rigid. Three areas where case matters:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Keywords like &ldquo;WHEN&rdquo;, FORCE and operators like OR etc. For keywords, three different formats are allowed: all upper-case, all lower-case, or a reasonable mix.<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN (Hand$AA) RaiseMax FORCE
When (Hand$AA) RaiseMax Force
when (Hand$AA) RaiseMax force
</pre>
</div>
For better readability we recommend to use only upper-case for keywords.
</li>
<li>
OpenHoldem symbols. Native OpenHoldem symbols are case-sensitive and always lower-case.<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN (pt_vpip0 &lt; 0.10) Fold FORCE
WHEN (balance0 &lt; 50) RaiseMax FORCE
</pre>
</div>
However: you will probably use these symbols very rarely in your code. Probably only to create poker-logical symbols like PT_OpenRaiser_VPIP and BigBlindStackSize.
</li>
<li>
OpenPPL-symbols that are part of the library. They are case-sensitive OH-script-functions with mixed upper and lower case letters.<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN (StillToAct &lt; 2) RAISETO 3 FORCE
</pre>
</div>
The naming is pretty intuitive, but the function that generates error-messages is smart enough to look for similar named symbols and will show you a helpful warning if something is wrong.
</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--7"></a>False Friends
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Again: case-sensitivity matters. There are some (only three) symbols with the &ldquo;same&rdquo; name that have a different meaning for OH-script and OpenPPL.

<div class="Indented">
You probably won’t need the OH-script symbols, but at least the library of OpenPPL-functions uses them internally, so they have to be there. For the first two cases OpenHoldem’s parser can detect if you took an identifier instead of an action and will warn you about that. But at the moment you need to take care about the latter case.

<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--8"></a>Keyword &ldquo;Set&rdquo; For User-Defined Variables
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Long story short: Shanky-PPL is an easy, English-like language that is intuitive to use, but it contains some technical flaws. For example, it can’t be parsed with a one-token-look-ahead like all other modern programming languages. This complicates the parser and especially the generation of good, helpful error-messages. Therefore we had to deviate at some points a liitle bit. The most conspicuous point is the new keyword &ldquo;Set&rdquo; before a user-variable:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">WHEN ... Set user_utg_limp_raised_preflop
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--9"></a>No Shanky-Style Delay
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">preflop
    WHEN ... RaiseBy 3 Delay 5 FORCE
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
A user-defined delay after an action simply does not fit the concept of functions, that traditionally return only a single value. Besides that: we believe that it is very clumsy to have thousands of lines with a fixed delay. OpenHoldem natively supports a solution that is way better suited for this use-case: a f$delay-functions.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It requires only some (or some dozen) lines of code for perfect randomized delays, depending e.g. on board-texture, betting-actions, etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$delay##
   WHEN UncoordinatedFlop AND Random &lt; 10 RETURN 2500 FORCE
   WHEN ...
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--10"></a>f$sitout Function
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
For similar reasons OpenPPL does no longer support a SitOut-command. We prefer to separate the playing logic from hopper-logic. Therefore OpenHoldem has a f$sitout-function. Furthermore OpenHoldem supports f$sitin, f$autopost, f$leave, f$close and some more. <div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">##f$InUTG##
    WHEN (dealposition = 3) RETURN True FORCE
​
##f$sitout##
   // issittingin, handsplayed and floppct are OpenHoldem symbols 
   // that can be used like any other OpenPPL symbol.
   // We wait until the orbit is finished and sitout
   // before we have to post the big blind again.
   WHEN (issittingin
        AND handsplayed &gt; 15 
        AND floppct &lt; 0.20 
        AND HaveNoCards 
        AND InUTG) 
     RETURN True Force  
</pre>
</div>

</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--11"></a>RaiseBy And RaiseTo Actions
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Let’s assume the following situation: you sit in the big blind and had to pay $10. Everybody folds to the button who raises to $30. Now it is your turn again and you decide to enter &ldquo;90&rdquo; into the raise-box. What does this mean?
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Well, it depends on the casino.
</div>
<ul>
<li>
at some casinos $90 will be your final betsize (RaiseTo, betsizeinterpretationmethod = 3)
</li>
<li>
other casinos will add $90 to the $10 you already posted, so the final betsize will be $100 (betsizeinterpretationmethod = 2).
</li>
<li>
and finally some other casinos will add these $90 to the $30 of the last raiser, so the final betsize will be $120 (RaiseBy, betsizeinterpretationmethod  = 1)
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
How does Shanky handle this Babylonian confusion?
</div>
<blockquote class="Quote">
In one case the small blind is counted as part of the pot and in the other it is not. This can vary between poker rooms as well. You just have to experiment to get it where you like and save each profile the way you want it.

<div class="Unindented">
However we don’t like undefined behaviour and we don’t want to keep multiple versions of our bots for different casinos either. Therefore we introduced 2 new commands: RaiseTo and RaiseBy. This way you can clearly specify what behaviour you want. You only have to specify the correct betsizeinterpretationmethod in your tablemap to tell OpenHoldem how your casino behaves and OpenHoldem will care about all the rest.automatically.
