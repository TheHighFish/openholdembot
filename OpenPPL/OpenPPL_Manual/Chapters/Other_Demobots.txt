Other Demobots

Winngy Fixed Limit

Back in the days when Ms Bunnybaker won one of the main poker events online-poker became very popular; lots of brick-and-mortar-players joined the online-tables. A visionary named Ray E. Bornert created the WinHoldem pokerbotting-framework for the fixed-limit games. A guy called Winngy used it to creat his first poker-bot. It played the so called low-stakes up to $10/$20 (big blind and big bet, not buyins). Casinos offered the same limits like in real casinos these days; and all revreational players used to choose the same limits they were used to from their local casino. 

So Winngy enjoyed a nice win-rate and at a new online-casino an equally nice prop-deal of 120% rakeback for a player who always hangs around in order to get the games started. Unfortunately for Winngy the fixed-limit games were drying up and bacame less popular due to a company named PokerTragedy and their chinese rakeback-slaves. So Winngy counted his winnings and moved on to other game-types. As a true gentlemen he donated his pokerbot to the OpenHoldem community for learning and tweaking.

Termita SNG

Onde day our member TheHighFish out of curiousity had a look at some Shanky demobots and came across a very special one.

It was a SBG-bot written by Tetre and Xiquetete, our member Termitapalahermita..

THF immediately recognized its potential.

The bot-logic was nicely written and well structured.

 It used dozens of user-variables in order to avoid code-clones and achieve a readable, selfdocumenting code.

 Furthermore it could be configured to play various types if SNGs nearly out of the box.

 So THF asked the sole creator who was left, Termita, for allowance to include this bot as a default-bot for OpenHoldem.

Termita agreed and so THF started to work, rewriting the entire bot.

OpenHoldem variables like StartingStackSize, StartingBligBlindSize and maxnplayersdealt made it possivle to get rid of the configuration section and detect the game-type automatically, be it 6-nax, 9-max, 10-max, deep-stack, normal, turbo or hyper-turbo.

When THF ran out of time and money Trish took over, a lady who plays poker since the shooting of Kennedy.

She finished the work, fine-tuned ranges, added some headsup-code and a little bit more aggression. Postflop was said to be based on a mixture of Doodle and Zulu, so it got completely removed in favour of roller-coaster Gecko.

Then we stepped a little bit back, looked at our work with pride and decided that it was a wonderful starting-point for every SNG-botter.
