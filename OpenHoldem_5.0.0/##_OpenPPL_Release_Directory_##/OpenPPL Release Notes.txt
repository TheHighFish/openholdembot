v4.4.1 2014-xx-xx
=================
NEW SYMBOL:
- New symbols: HadSetOnFlop, HadSetOnTurn (doc not updated)
 [Lavezzi]
  
BUG FIXES:
- 2ndTopFlopCard was returning incorrect value with pair of board.
  This has now been fixed. 
  [Lavezzi]
  
v4.4.0 2014-01-14
=================
NEW STUFF:
- Support for "BEEP FORCE" and "CLOSE FORCE".
  The latter one will check/fold, then sitout and finally close the table.
  [THF]
- Support for OpenHoldems new board$-symbol.
  Finally we are able to translate all board-expresssions and even in a more natural way.
  This also leads to far smaller and more readable log-files.
  [THF]
  
BUG FIXES:
- Translation of memory-symbols missed a prefix in the past.
  This has now been fixed. Thanks to Hugo1 for reporting.
  [THF]

MAINTENANCE:
- Adding more warnings about bad coding-style to bracketify.pl,
  especially about missing spaces between keywords, 
  which is ok for standard-PPL.
  [THF]
- Lots of cmall changes to the OpenPPL-library and to OpenPPL.exe to make it compatible with OpenHoldem 4.4.0+.
  [THF]
- OpenPPL does no longer require "mh_str_Handstrength_Library.ohf",
  as it used only one function in the past (mh_kickerbetter)
  and this symbol got now implemented directly in the OpenPPL-library.
  [THF]

v4.0.3 2013-02-24
=================
NEW STUFF:
- Support for OpenHoldems new betpot-functions and betpot-buttons.
  [THF]

BUG FIXES: 
- The technical function 
  f$OpenPPL_RaisesBeforeOurFirstActionThisRoundPreflopNotInTheBlinds
  did not consider a missing small blind and therefore "Raises" could be wrong.
  Thanks to Bimmer for finding the problem.
  [THF]
- Small fixes to the mh_handstrength_library
  [Nik0]
  
v4.0.1 2013-xx-xx
=================
NEW STUFF:
- New symbols: TwoPairOnBoardOnTurn, TripsRank, TripsKickerRank, ThirdTopPairRank, ForthTopPairRank, FifthTopPairRank, Have5thTopPair, StackSizeAtBeginningOfCurrentRound
  Had2ndTopPairOnFlop, PT_ButtonVPIP, Had2ndOverPairOnTurn
 [Lavezzi]
 - NumberOfOpponentsAllin did not count a villan betting our stack size as being allin. Although this is not an error its easier for bot coding considering him as allin.
 [Lavezzi]
 
 BUG FIXES:  
- OpponentStacksizeHeadsUp was not returning any value when HeadsUp with one or more opponents allin - this has now been fixed. 
  [Lavezzi]
- OpenEndedStraightDrawPossibleOnFlop was returning wrong value on paired board. Thanks to Invader11 for providing the patch.
  [Lavezzi]

v4.0.0 2013-01-26
=================
NEW STUFF:
- Adding support for bitwise operations (BitAnd, BitOr, BitNot, BitXor).
  Thanks to Termitapalahermita for providing the patch.
  [THF]
  
BUG FIXES:   
- Making DLL-symbols work in combination with OpenPPL.
  In the past they had been rejected as "unknown".
  Thanks to Termitapalahermita for providing the patch.
  [THF]
  
MAINTENANCE:
- OpenPPL does no longer make use of the file
  "OpenPPL_SwagFunctions_For_OpenHoldem_2.1.x_Only_Please_Delete_This_File_Once_You_Use_OpenHoldem_2.2.0_And_Later.ohf"
  because that is now built-in functionality of OpenHoldem 4.0.0.
  [THF]
- As we moved OpenHoldems hand-strength-symbols to a text-based library
  OpenPPL does now need the file "mh_str_Handstrength_Library.ohf", which gets shipped as part of the release.
  [THF]
- Optionally adding "My_Custom_OH_Script_Code.ohf" if you have custom OH-script-code
  that you want to use in combination with OpenPPL.
  [THF]

v1.3.1 2012-11-10
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- The uploaded version of bracketify did print some debug-output that made the generated code unusable.
  Thanks to Cash for reporting.
  [THF]

v1.3.0 2012-11-08
=================
NEW STUFF:
- Supporting prefold. Please see the manual for details.
  [THF]

BUG FIXES: 
- Bracketify did add an extra closing bracket after memory-store-commands
  when generating the line-info. This has now been fixed.
  Thanks to TwinWinNerD for reporting.
  [THF]

v1.2.0 2012-10-11
=================
NEW STUFF:
- An OHF profile-optimizer, that replaces the code for open-ended when-conditions
  by functions. This way old Shanky-style profiles with long code-sequences 
  can get about 20..50% smaller and estimated 2..10 times faster.
  Please see the updated manual for detailed info.
  A big thanks to Rehlby for providing this tool.
  [THF]	
- Bracketify is now able to modify a profile in a way
  that it logs line-numbers to the debug-log,
  but only for statements that get executed,
  i.e. actions, return statements, user-defined variables to be set
  and OpenHoldems memory-store-command (me_st_xyz_123).
  The generated code could e.g. look like
  "[condition  &&  log$line_123_Act] RAISEMAX FORCE"
  and "line_123_Act" would appear in the log if that line got executed.
  [THF]
- Bracketify does now warn about multi-line-expressions that can't be handled
  (as long as the word wrap happens in a reasonable way with keywords like AND or OR
  at the beginning or at the end).
  [THF]
- Bracketify does now detect unsafe comparisions such as Stacksize = 17,
  which don't work on OH-side because OH uses real numbers like 17.28.
  It does now generate a warning and terminate.  
  It is highly recommended to use <, <=, > and >= at such spots instead.
  [THF]
- Bracketify does now auto-correct "NutFullHouseOrFourOfAKind = 0"
  to "NutFullHouseOrFourOfAKind = f$OpenPPL_HINT_We_Dont_Have_A_FullHouse_At_All",
  because OpenPPL uses consistently higher numbers for worse hands
  and 999 if we don't have a full house at all.
  [THF]
- New symbols BotCheckedPreflop, BotCheckedOnFlop, BotCheckedOnTurn, BotCheckedOnRiver,
  TopPairRank and TopPairKickerRank
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol PokerTracker symbols PT_LastCaller_VPIP, PT_LastCaller_PFR and PT_OpponentVPIPHeadsUp
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol OpponentStacksizeHeadsUp
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol Had2ndOverPairOnFlop, Had2ndOverPairOnTurn
  [THF]
  

BUG FIXES: 
- "Check Force" didn't work - this has now been fixed.
  Thanks to Studyx for reporting.
- Resetting variables did sometimes not work in the first hand
  when the same instance of OpenHoldem connected to a new table
  to play a second session.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting and for suggesting a fix.
  [THF]
- MaxOpponentStacksize and MinOpponentStacksize were not accurate in the blinds.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting. 
- The symbols "nhands..." and "nsuited..." did not get accepted by the converter.
  This has now been fixed.
  Thanks to LadyBerril for reporting.
  [THF]
- Suited board expressions like "WHEN BOARD = AT SUITED"
  did not work correctly due to missing brackets.
  Thanks to Chucksta for reporting the problem.
  [THF]
- Suited hand expressions didn't work either because we somehow 
  used the wrong operator. 
  Thanks to Postenjak for finding this funny bug.
  [THF]
- When the user decided to "fold" where a check was possible
  BotsLastAction was wrong. This has now been fixed.
  Thanks to Postenjak for finding the problem and suggesting a fix.
  [THF]
- Detecting players who are allin did not work at some casinos,
  because the bet of that player got immediatelly moved to the main-pot,
  whereas we checked not only for a zero-balance, but also for a positive bet.
  This has now been fixed (for Ongame; please notify us, if other casinos behave in the same way).
  Thanks to Postenjak for finding the problem.
  [THF]

  
v1.1.1 2012-07-01
=================
NEW STUFF:
- Bracketify was formerly not smart enough to distinguish
  open-ended when conditions with a user-variable at the end
  and normal conditions with a user-variable to be set instead of an action.
  This does now work.
  [THF]
- New symbol OpponentsOnTurn 
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol OpponentsOnRiver
  [Lavezzi]
- Some PokerTracker-symbols do now require a minimum sample-size.
  If there are too few hands the symbol will be considered unusable and -1 will be returned.
  Similar changes are planned for the other PT-symbols.
  [Lavezzi, THF]
- New symbol TotalInvestedThisRound
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol PT_LastRaiser_Hands
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol HaveRunnerRunnerFlushAtRiver
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol RunnerRunnerFlushPossibleAtRiver
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol PT_SmallBlind_FoldSBToSteal
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol HaveTopTrips
  [Lavezzi]

BUG FIXES: 
- HaveNothing was true also if we had straight or flush draw.
  This has now been fixed.
  [Lavezzi]
- PotSize amount was incorrect if an opponent currentbet was bigger than the sum of our currentbet and balance (giving false pot odds when comparing AmountToCall to PotSize).
  EffectivePotsize symbol solved the problem but we needed to propagate the solution directly into PotSize symbol. 
  Thanks to THF for the code.
  This has now been fixed.   
  [Lavezzi]
- RankOfSpareCardWhenTwoPairOnBoard was not returning correct value when the spare card was at river.
  This has now been fixed.
  [Lavezzi]
- StraightPossibleOnFlop and StraightPossibleOnTurn didn't work because of mis-paced brackets
  in combination with the bit-count-operator. Thanks to Lavezzi for reporting.
  [THF]
   
MAINTENANCE:
- EffectivePotsize symbol has been removed cause now PotSize returns effective pot size.
  [Lavezzi]
- Removing RankOfPairOnBoard again, as it was a duplicate to RankOfTopPairOnBoard.
  [THF]
  
v1.1.0 2012-06-10
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- bracketify.pl forgot the closing paranthesis before a Raise (expression) statement.
  [Lavezzi]
- HaveTopSet was not correct due to istreeofakind logic/bug when twopair on board.
  This has now been fixed.
  [Lavezzi]
- The converter did generate code for partial matches,
  so "RAISE (expression) FORCE did get translated incorrectly.
  This has now been fixed.
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_SmallBlind: A dead player between us and the dealer who sits in again
  changes our dealposition to 2, so we are seen as being BigBlind.
  This has now been fixed. 
  [Lavezzi]
- "WheelPossible" didn't work due to misplaced brackets.
  Thanks to Lavezzi for reporting.
  [THF]
- Raises could be -1 if there were additional blind-posters
  (incorrect value of nopponentsraising). Thie bsa to be handled
  on OH-side, but we added some sanity-checks.
  Thanks to Lavezzi for reporting.
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF:
- RankOfPairOnBoard has been implemented
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol RankOfSpareCardWhenTwoPairOnBoard
  [Lavezzi]
- New symbol StraighFlushOnBoard
  [Lavezzi]

v1.0.7 2012-05-28
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- Redesigned decision-function affected BotsLastAction
  and f$alli (in case a potsized bet was larger than our stack).
  This has now been fixed. 
  Thanks to Lavezzi and Postenjak for reporting and for the help.
  [THF]
- HaveNutStraight didn't consider NutStraightFlushes.
  Thanks to Lavezzi for reporting.
  [THF]
- OpenPPL didn't automatically execute allin if a potsized bet was larger than our balance.  
  [Lavezzi]
- StillToAct did work only preflop.
  Thanks to Lavezzi for reporting and to Postenjak for the postflop-code.
  [THF]
- BotsLastPreflopAction could be initialized twice (read: incorrectly) on the flop.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting and for suggesting a fix.
  [THF]
- InitMissingSmallBlind could be potentially called twice if we check preflop
  and the action comes back to us (if we post a blind out of order).
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting and for suggesting a fix.
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF:
- Now supporting expressions after "RAISE" keyword, e.g.
    * RAISE (3 + Calls) FORCE
	* RAISE (MyFavouriteBetsizeForDryBoards) FORCE
  Please not that in both cases brackets are mandatory.	
  [THF]
- New symbol HaveBottomTrips.
  [Lavezzi]

v1.0.6 2012-04-23
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- f$OpenPPL_PlayersBehindDealPosition2ChairDidAct didn't work correctly because of a typo.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- Improved betsize for percentaged potsized bets had one division by 100 too much.
  Thanks to Subiendolo and Kalamees for reporting and to Lavezzi for a log-file.
  [THF]	
- some memory symbols got reset only once per hand, 
  despite they should reset once per turn.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_BetSizeForFixedBetInBigBlinds incorrectly assumed, 
  that ncallbets returns a dollar-value, whereas is returns 
  the number of bets after we call.
  Thanks to DonQuay for providing a log-file 
  and to Postenjak for finding the problem.
  [THF]
- New f$Decision function broke some backup-actions.
  In case of an impossible potsize-bet OH did no longer raise-min.
  Thanks to PokerValy and Lavezzi for reporting 
  and to Postenjak for suggesting a fix.
  [THF]
- bracketify.pl forgot the closing parenthesis before a return statement.
  Thanks to Lavezzi for reporting.
  [THF]
  
MAINTENANCE:
- Now displaying a more lenghty ocde-snippet in case of an error,
  hoping that we also show a comment with a line-number.
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF:
- Bracketify.pl does now add comments with line-numbers 
  for every single line of code, as we didn't get boosts position-operator to work.
  This work-around should be good enough to identify the location of an error.
  [THF]

v1.0.5 2012-04-09
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- CHECK FORCE was implemented in the library 
  but didn't get translated by the converter.
  Thanks to Subiendolo for reporting.
  [THF]
- NutFullhouseOr4OfAKind could return wrong values
  due to missing brackets at one place.
  Thanks to Lavezzi for reporting the problem and providing a log-file.
  [THF]
- f$Decision-function and calculation of potsized bets
  got reworked. Potsized bet and automatic betsize-adaption 
  should now work.
  Thanks to Postenjak and Lavezzi who helped to fix the problem.
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF:
- New symbols InEarlyPosition, InMiddlePosition, InLatePosition, InTheBlinds
  to simplify the cases where you don't care about your exact positions.
  [THF]

v1.0.4 2012-03-19
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- User-defined variables did reset every heartbeat
  instead of once per hand.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- bracketify.pl did not recognize user-defined-variables
  with numbers in the name.
  Thanks to SuperBlak for reporting.
  [THF]
- NumberOfOpponentsLimpingPreflop didn't work due to misplaced brackets.
  Thanks to KaeKruse for reporting and for providing the fix.
  [THF]
- antes are considered "blind-raisers", 
  so "Raises" needs some adaption, if antes are present.
  Unfortunatelly "ante" can be true without antes being visible (as bets)
  on some casinos, which causes incorrect results.
  f$OpenPPL_AntesPresent does now consider only visible antes
  like nopponentsraising does to avoid this  problem.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- Additional spaces and comments together with "New Symbol XYZ"
  could throw OpenPPL off in the preprocessing stage (building a list of symbols).
  Thanks to Relhby for reporting the problem and to PhBot1 
  for suggesting an inprovement.
  Additional white-spaces get now deleted, but comments 
  are still a problem at this place.
  [THF]
- BetPot incorrectly used RaiseHalfPot instead of RaisePot.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF}
- Calculation of botsized bets was not correct.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting the problem and for providing the info to fix it.
  [/HF]
- bracketify.pl didn't replace all tabs by spaces.
  Thanks to Volker0866 for reporting.
  [THF]
- Opponents and OpponentsLeft was incorrect, 
  trying to meet Shankys somewhat strange definition.
  We do now consider all active players as live opponents,
  including players who are allin.
  Thanks to Rehlby for reporting and for suggesting the fix.
  [THF]
  
MAINTENANCE:
- Considering MissingSmallBlind when calculating positions of the players at the table.
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF: 
- MissingSmallBlind
  [THF]

v1.0.3 2012-02-21
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- The sitout command was designed to work with OpenHoldem 2.2.0+,
  which has not yet been released. Support for OH 2.1.9.x has been added.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_RankBitsCommonWithoutTopBit used rankbits instead of
  rankbitscommon. This affected the calculation of 2ndbestBoardCard,
  Have2ndTopPair, Have2ndOverPair, etc.
  Thanks to MarkShmiter for reporting and to KaeKruse and JokeDoke for the fix.
  [THF]
- Some backup-actions didn't work. 
  OpenPPL didn't raise or call when we wanted to go allin,
  but no allin-button was found. This has now been fixed.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]  
- TwoPairOnBoard confused istwopair (boolean) and twopair (a bit-value).
  This did affect the calculation of NutFullHouseOrFourOfAKind.
  Thanks to SteveG1963 for reporting.
  [THF]  
- RaisesSinceLastPlay did use f$OpenPPL_BotsActionsOnThisRound 
  instead of f$OpenPPL_BotsActionsOnThisRoundIncludingChecks.
  This could lead to wrong initializations.
  Thanks to MarkShmiter for reporting.
  [THF]
- InitBotsLastActionPreflop did incorrectly use an undefined BotsLastAction
  for initialization on first orbit preflop and therefore didn't work. 
  To make things worse it did affect BotsLastAction also, 
  because the value of this symbol got cached and later reused. 
  This has now been fixed.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- MiddlePosition3, MP2 and MP1 didn't work because of a typo.
  Thanky to Kyo for reporting.
  [THF]
- SuitsOnBoard did also count "undefined" suits.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting and providing good info.
  [THF]

MAINTENANCE:
- Some new option settings for deletion in bracketify.pl.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]

NEW STUFF: 
- Added symbol HavePocketPair.
  [THF]
- New symbols SuitsOnTurn and SuitsOnRiver.
  [THF]
  
  
  
v1.0.2 2012-02-03
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- f$alli confused balance (counted in dollars) and f$OpenPPL_StackSize
  (counted in bets). This could cause incorrect allins.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting and providing the fix.
  [THF]
- OneCardStraightPosibleOnTurn had been missing in the library.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]

  
  
v1.0.1 2012-02-02
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- Automatic betsize-adjustmeant could lead to minraises
  even if we didn't want to raise. Thanks to Postenjak for reporting. 
  [THF]
- HaveTwoPair didn't work. Ace gets set twice in rankbits, 
  as high (bit 14 = ace) and as low (bit 1). This got counted as two pairs.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_LowestBitOfRankBitsCommon did a bit-shift in the wrong direction,
  which affected the calculation of HaveBottomTwoPair.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_NumberOfUnknownSuitedOvercards didn't search for overcards
  to heros holecards, but to the high card of the flush(draw).
  This affected the result of HaveNutFlushDraw, etc.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- RaisesbeforeOurFirstActionPreflopInbigBlind was wrong.
  This affected the symbol Raises if we were in big blind.
  Thanks to MarkShmiter for reporting.
  [THF]
- Bracketify.pl split InBigBlind etc. into two words,
  even if it was part of a larger lexeme (like UserVillainBigBlind).
  Thanks to Jaredlee for reporting.
  [THF]
  
MAINTENANCE:
- Some symbols like Raises depend on game-history.
  They get calculated and updated whenever the autoplayer acts.
  However: the autoplayer can possibly act more than once per turn
  (because of incorrect delay settings or too many buttons in ManualMode)
  which could throw the calculation off.
  To prevent this we do now remember the gamestate
  (by dealerchair, pot and currentbet) and do only update the symbols
  if at least one of these symbols did change.
  This way the calculation of more complex symbols
  should become way more stable. 
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF:
- Support for specific suits in hand-expressions, 
  e.g. "WHEN Hand = AcTh" or "WHEN Hand = AdK".
  [THF]

  

v1.0.0 2012-01-25
=================
- First public release: OpenPPL converter and supporting library.
  The OpenPPL converter translates (Open)PPL to OH-script.

  OpenPPL is part of the OpenHoldem project
    Download page:         http://code.google.com/p/openholdembot/

  Required OpenHoldem version: 2.2.0 or later
    (if you want to use all symbols. 
    "isfinaltable" is not supported by OH 2.1.x and earlier versions.)
