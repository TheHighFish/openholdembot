# Rules2Cpp
# =========
#
# PURPOSE: Translating rules for the OH-Validator
#   into usable CPP-code (preprocessor-macros).
#
# USAGE: At the command-line:
#   "perl rules2cpp.pl <THE_RULES_FILE>"
#   This will print the generated code to stdout.
#
# NOTE: For bitwise operations you have to typecast
#   gws-operands to integer manually.

# Rules look like this:
#
# BEGIN_TESTCASE
#     TESTCASE_ID ("0074")
#     REASONING ("Range check for symbol nbetstorais")
#     PRECONDITION (true)
#     POSTCONDITION (nbetstorais >= 1)
#     SYMBOLS_POSSIBLY_AFFECTED ("nbetstorais")
# END_TESTCASE
#
# We only have to put each symbol into a gws-function-call,
#   and leave the rest as is.
