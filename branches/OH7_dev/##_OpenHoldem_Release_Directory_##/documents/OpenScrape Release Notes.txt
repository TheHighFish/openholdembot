v5.0.3 2014-07-18
==================
- OpenHoldem and OpenScrape could crash when evaluating ttlimits,
  as a very rarely executed branch of the code had a missing 
  pointer-dereference, but the code was compileable anyway.
  Thanks to SuperBlak for reporting and for providing replay-frames and TM.
  [THF]

v5.0.1 2014-07-05
==================
NEW STUFF: 
- support fr pXcardfaceYnocard and c0cardfaceXbocard regions
  for better error-detection and faster scraping.
  [THF]

v4.2.4 2013-09-xx
==================
NEW STUFF: 
- OpenScrape still uses a list-dialog to allow the user to select the table.
  That was a bit difficult however for tables without a title.
  Therefore we show now a fake title: "HWND: xyz1234" for such case.
  [Termitapalahermita]

v4.1.0 2013-04-23
==================
BUG FIXES:
- The code to handle regions had no call to disable_and_clear_all(),
  so some data could be initialized with old values.
  http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=156&t=16412 
  Thanks to ZooBoy for reporting.
  [THF]

v4.0.2 2013-02-08
=================
BUG FIXES:
- One function had an IO-parameter instead of a local variable.
  The input got never set and the output never used.
  This caused a an exception and has now been fixed.
  [THF]

NEW STUFF: 
- Support for new symbol isfinaltable (OH 4.0.0)
  [THF]

MAINTENANCE:
- Removed support for now unused symbol istournament.
  [THF]
  
v4.0.0 2013-01-26
=================
NEW STUFF:
- Added a tool to clone regions (Menu -> Tools -> Region Cloner).
  This tool simplifies the task of creating a tablemap.
  Once you have all regions for player0 and the first common-card defined
  just use the region-cloner to create regions with equal properties
  for all other chairs and cards. The regions will even get moved
  to somewhat reasonable places at the table.
  All you have to do: fine-tune the positions.
  [THF]

v2.1.8 2011-01-15
=================
BUG FIXES:
- OpenScrape crashed when pressing the "+" and "-" buttons for the pixel separation view.
  This has now been fixed. [JumpingFences]

v2.1.6 2010-07-xx
=================
MAINTENANCE:
- Improved some cryptic error messages. [THF] 

v2.1.3 2010-03-03
=================
BUG FIXES:
- The code to modify or delete the character "(" failed,
  as the lookup of the font-type was not able to handle 
  the special case "( (N)" with 2 open brackets  
  instead of usually one bracket "X (N)". That has been fixed. 
  Thanks to Funnydwag and Winny for reporting and reproducing the problem. 
  [THF]

v2.1.0 2009-12-26
=================
NEW STUFF
- Added "scraperpredll" to valid s$strings list.  This new symbols instructs OpenHoldem to load the specified external scraperpre
  DLL file. [OpenHoldem]

v2.0.3 2009-10-23
=================
BUG FIXES:
- OS allowed to create fonts with more or less than 1 character,
  which caused malformed tablemaps.
  This is now prevented by a sanity-check. [THF]

v2.0.2 2009-09-01
==============
BUG FIXES:
- OS didn't handle t3-records. [BillW]
- Images with negative width or negative height caused a crash.
  Thanks to BBUK for reporting and to Ares for explaining. [THF]

v2.0.1 2009-07-17
=================
BUG FIXES:
- Initialized a pointer to NULL, which previously was not initialized. Thanks to fishyphil5 for the patch. [THF]
- File-archive was closed incorrectly, which caused a crash for debug-builds. Thanks to fishyphil5 for the patch. [THF]
- Fixed some memory leaks. [THF]

v2.0.0 2009-05-22
=================
BUG FIXES:
- Fixed a crash when you delete the last Hash from a hast type (Hash0 for example). This crash was only in the pre-release versions [spew]
- Fix to Add New Symbol dialog, whereby change to dropdown was not always enabling/disabling TitleText, ParseResults,
  and ParseButton fields correctly.
- Applied fix from maintenance branch that addresses an internal index not being updated when deleting a font record, 
  causing a scrambling of OCR results when a T-transform region was displayed after the delete.  Thanks to USBFreak for 
  identifying the problem [OpenHoldem]
- Table map region rectangles are now properly drawn and utilized.  Previously, the right and bottom edges of the
  rectangle were ignored, both when being drawn in OpenScrape, and when being used in transforms in OpenHoldem.  The
  implications of this is that v1 regions require updating, and will be handled automatically in OpenScrape.
  The file version for .tm's will be updated to ".osdb2" when saved with version 2.0.0+ of OpenScrape.  Opening 
  of older .tm file versions in either OpenHoldem or OpenScrape will result in a warning message with similar 
  information to the above being displayed. [OpenHoldem]
- Tab order in table map dialog was incorrect.  Thanks, Friday.  [OpenHoldem]
      
MAINTENANCE:
- Migration of table map z, s, r, t, p, h and i record handling from CArray's with manual indices to std::map structures. [OpenHoldem]
- Removal of identifying information from Properties/Version display in Windows Explorer. [OpenHoldem]

NEW STUFF:
- Added "swagselectionmethod", "swagdeletionmethod", "swagconfirmationmethod" and "buttonclickmethod" to valid s$strings list.
  The settings that might be saved in the registry from previous OpenHoldem versions are now ignored for these methods.  If these
  methods are not specified in the .tm file, then the default actions are:
  swagselectionmethod = Dbl Click  (valid values are "Sgl Click", "Dbl Click", "Click Drag" or "Nothing")
  swagdeletionmethod = Delete  (valid values are "Delete", "Backspace" or "Nothing")
  swagconfirmationmethod = Enter  (valid values are "Enter", "Click Bet" or "Nothing")
  buttonclickmethod = Double  (valid values are "Single" or "Double")
  [OpenHoldem]
- Added "handresetmethod" to valid s$strings list.  This new symbol instructs the OpenHoldem engine as to which scrape changes 
  should be used as a trigger to identify a "hand reset" event. This is a bitmapped integer; only one of the selected scrape
  changes needs to occur in order for the scrape to be considered a "hand reset".  The values below are in hexadecimal format,
  but the value assigned to the "handresetmethod" symbol must be specified in decimal (base-10) format.  As an example, if you
  want to instruct OpenHoldem to treat a change in dealer button OR a change in player cards as a "hand reset", then 
  "handresetmethod" should be set to 5.  If you want to instruct OpenHoldem to treat only a change in dealer button as a 
  "hand reset", then "handresetmethod" should be set to 1.
  - 0x00000001 = dealer button
  - 0x00000010 = handnumber
  - 0x00000100 = player cards (not triggered by change to "no cards" or to "card backs")
  [OpenHoldem]
- Added uXdealer and uXbet to valid r$strings list.  These new regions correlate to the pXdealer and pXbet regions in much the
  same way as uXname/pXname and uXbalance/pXbalance. [OpenHoldem]
- Added "scraperdll" to valid s$strings list.  This new symbols instructs OpenHoldem to load the specified external scraper
  override DLL file. [spew]
- Added "balancenumbersonly" to valid s$strings list.  This setting allows you to specify that all characters besides numbers 
  (0-9 and dot/decimal separator) are stripped from the text transform result for balance regions.  This is useful for those
  casinos that include spurious/changing alphanumeric information in their balance boxes.  Setting this string to "True" or
  "Yes" will enable balance cleansing, any other value or the absence of this string will result in no balance cleansing.
  Thanks to Nick Coldhand for the patch.  [OpenHoldem]
- Added "chipscrapemethod" to valid s$strings list.  This setting allows you to specify that the scraper engine should check
  either all 200 possible chip locations (10 stacks of 20 chips) or a certain grid of chip locations everytime a chip scrape 
  region is required.  The direction searched is determined by the 01 and 10 landing spots in relation to the 00 landing spot.
  The default behavior is to stop checking a given stack when there is no match, and to stop checking all stacks when the base 
  chip for that stack does not match. 
  . This new symbols is only valid when a region specifies the 00, 01, and 10 locations only.  For regions that specify 
  other chip landing spots, those chips/stacks will be checked as per previous behavior.  
  . A value of "All" will trigger the "check all 200 locations" behavior.
  . A value of "XxY" will trigger the check of X stacks of Y chips.
  . Any other value will result in the original stop checking behavior as described.  [OpenHoldem]
- Upon creating a new hash record "Create Hash", the hash will be calculated and inserted in the new record.  Previously,
  a zero hash was inserted necessitating the use of menu item "Edit/Update Hashes" to calculate the correct values.
  [OpenHoldem]
- Menu item added to duplicate regions - select a region in the map, and choose "Edit/Duplicate Region".  A dialog will be
  presented with a list of related regions that are valid copy targets. You can multi-select in this dialog with the standard
  Control-click and Shift-click modifiers.  [OpenHoldem]
- Applied Oscar's keyboard control patch for OpenScrape. You can now move regions using he arrow keys, fast-move regions using
  shift+arrow keys, and resize regions using ctrl+arrow keys. Applied Bender's patch to allow diagonal movement with
  the corner numpad keys (1,3,7,9) [OpenHoldem]
- Added option to group regions in display tree by type or name (View/Group Regions, View/Ungroup Regions) [OpenHoldem]
- Added display of rectangle size in rectangle box (Thanks BillW for the patch) [OpenHoldem]
- Applied Oscar's patch:
  - When you select refresh it will bring the targeted window to the front, scrape it, then place it to the back again.
  - Also if you are connected to OHReplay it moves to the next screen before scraping
  - Keyboard shortcuts: F3 - Connect, F4 - Show Region Boxes, F5 - Refresh Scrape, F1 - Help/About, Control + U - Update Hashes
  [OpenHoldem]
- Applied Bender's patch, replaces "Create hash" dialog with four create hash buttons.  [OpenHoldem]
- Applied Bender's patch, enables Insert and Delete keys for adding/deleting records to the .tm file.  [OpenHoldem]


v1.1.8 2008-10-21
=================
MAINTENANCE:
- Removal of fatal_error.log creation on crash.  This has been replaced by minidumps.
- Further stabilization of code tree, especially regarding class encapsulation and thread critical section handling.
- The Optimizer in the compiler has now been enabled by default for Release builds.


v1.1.7 2008-08-22
=================
MAINTENANCE:
- All level 3 compiler warnings have been addressed.

BUG FIXES:
- Eliminated artificial limitations on the number of font or hash records that can be present in any given tablemap (.tm) file.
  Previously this was set to 512 for each.  Thank you to Nick Coldhand & Folder for busting the limit.  (OpenHoldem)
  

v1.1.6 2008-08-22
=================
MAINTENANCE:
- Minidumps are now generated automatically upon a crash - dumps can be found in your OpenScrape
  startup directory. This feature requires dbghelp.dll to be distributed with OpenScrape.  This file
  should be placed in the same directory where OpenScrape.exe lives. 


v1.1.5 2008-05-16
================
NEW STUFF:
- Added image ("I") transform capability with perceptual difference algorithm (OpenHoldem)
- Removed warning and region removal for handle and slider regions, to support the
  addition of slider jamming code into OH. (BillW)
  
BUG FIXES:
- Removed the statusbar of the tablemap dialog, which caused mispositioning and flickering.
  Displaying the information about unscraped cards and fonts now in 2 text fields. (TheHighFish)

MAINTENANCE:
- As part of the pdiff implementation and tuning, I got tired of updating the table map load/save
  code in two places, and have moved this code to the CTransform class where it belongs.  A great
  deal of code was touched (more than I anticipated), so please test carefully.  (OpenHoldem)
  
  
v1.1.4 2008-04-25
================
NEW STUFF:
- Edit button functionality added for font records. Only character and font group can be changed. (BillW)

v1.1.3 2008-04-11
================
NEW STUFF:
- New symbol s$activemethod is now available.  This is used to determine how OH treats
  information from the pXactive and uXactive regions.
  - 1: (default, legacy) Inactive unless pXactive/uXactive returns true/active
  - 2: (new) Active unless pXactive/Uxactive returns false/inactive/out/away  (Thanks,
    Nick Coldhand)  (quiqsilver)


v1.1.2 2008-03-28
================
NEW STUFF:
- New symbol s$potmethod is now available.  This is used to determine the appropriate
  site interpretation for the contents of c0pot0.  s$potmethod can be set to these values:
  - 1: (default, legacy) Common pot
  - 2: (new) Total pot, including current bets and side bets  (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)
  (quiqsilver)


v1.1.1 2008-03-15
================
NEW STUFF:
- New symbol s$network is now available.  This is used to determine the appropriate
  network to pull Poker Tracker data for when s$sitename is not a PT supported site.  OH will
  first check s$sitename for a supported network name, then s$network.  These are the supported
  names for both s$sitename and s$network and must be lowercase: stars, party, ultimate, absolute,
  microgaming, ongame, cryptologic, pacific, fulltilt, b2b, tribeca, worldpex, ipoker, tain,
  bodog, everest, boss, and betfair. (quiqsilver)
  
- The entry window now has a status bar which displays common characters that are missing a font
  definition on the left side, and cards that are missing a hash on the right side for easy
  reference. (Thanks, Folder and dipitlow)
  - The entry window now has a "Tracker" section to set options for what is displayed in the status
    bar: (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)
    - Fonts Set: Select which font set to display missing fonts for.
    - Fonts #: Select the number of fonts desired for each character in the currently selected set.
    - Cards #: Select the number of card hashes desired for each card. (quiqsilver)
    
- OpenScrape's behavior when creating hashes and images is now consistent with its font creation
  behavior: 
  - The selection will now return to the previously selected image or region respectively.
  - When the first hash or image is created, the respective section will gain the '+' button to
    indicate it now has a member and can be expanded. (quiqsilver)

BUG FIXES:
- Create Font button would search all groups to find unknown character when it should have
  only searched within the matching text group (spew)

- Launching a .tm file from the Windows shell launches OS, which crashes immediately. (quiqsilver)

- CTransform::h_transform; check for left>right or bottom>top added to prevent crashes.  (OpenHoldem)

- CTransform::do_plain_font_scan:  fix for searching of matching fonts across groups applied to
  CTransform class; same problem as Spew's fix above.

- Source code:  CTransform class (transform.cpp and transform.h) now live outside of the OpenHoldem and OpenScrape
  directories, so it can be shared without manually needing to copy code from place to place.  (OpenHoldem)
    

v1.1.0 2008-02-22
================
NEW STUFF:
- Table maps using fuzzy fonts can now be created.
  - Decide which fonts will be fuzzy, and create those in a specifc group (e.g. group 1).
    Fonts can be created with the font color as the foreground, or the background color
    as the foreground (inverse fonting).  If using the font color for the foreground, it is
    probably best to make the fonts as thick as possible using large radii.  If using the
    background color as the foreground, a radius of zero probably works best.
  - Set the symbol t1type to "fuzzy" for default tolerance (25%), or to a specific tolerance
    value (0.50 for 50%, 0.33 for 33%, for example).  If this symbol is set to anything besides
    "fuzzy" or a floating point value, then the engine will used the old pixel-by-pixel font
    recognition engine.
  - You can create multiple samples for various characters, and it will help.  6/8/3, for example
    are all so similar that distinguishing fuzzy versions of these is difficult.  Create more
    font records for the various 6's, 8s and 3's will help with the recognition.

- OpenHoldem and OpenScrape now use a unified CTransform class (this is found in the
  transform.cpp/.h files).

- Add Font (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont):
  - When adding font records via the add font dialog, the selection will now return to the
    previously selected region record, instead of nothing.
  - Known characters are now *not* added to the "Add Font" dialog.
  
- Added nudge buttons to move region around.  (Thanks to the many suggestions for this)

- Added tooltips to the main table map editor dialog.



BUG FIXES:
- Clicking new when "Size" was selected would not create a new size record on closure of the
  Add Sizes dialog box.  (Thanks, quiqsilver)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedNew)
  
- Rare bug fixed where clicking on "Create Font" and when the character separation algorithm
  detected characters in excess of the largest width allowed (31 pixels) would cause a crash.
  The algorithm now checks for more than 31 pixels and truncates the size of that character to 
  31 pixels.  (Thanks, the_whopper)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont)
  
- Drawing region rectangles will now operate properly whether you draw top-left to bottom-right,
  bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, or bottom-left to top-right.
  (COpenScrapeView::OnLButtonUp, COpenScrapeView::OnMouseMove) (Thanks, cidertime)
  

v1.0.5 2008-02-15
================
BUG FIXES:
- More stupidity with clicking "New" and crashing has been corrected.  num_s$strings was 
  set to an incorrect value. (OpenScrapeDoc.h)
  

v1.0.4 2008-02-08
================
NEW STUFF:
- Commented out "Hash record created.  Don't forget to 'Edit/Update Hashes'." MessageBox.
  (Thanks, Nick)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateHash)
  

BUG FIXES:
- New button was not working for symbols and regions.  (Thanks, JumpingFences) 
  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedNew)
  


v1.0.3 2008-02-01
================
NEW STUFF:
- Added graphical hash point editor.  Select the "Hash Points" parent node in the tree and click the
  edit button.  Make sure to not select one of the specific hash point child records, as this will 
  bring up the editor for just that record - this capability has been retained in case you still need
  it.


BUG FIXES:
- Multiple t$ records specifying the same character are now allowed.  (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)
  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont)
- Internal fix to use SetItemData/GetItemData methods of CTreeCtrl, to allow for more efficient
  and flexible handling of data display when a tree item is clicked.   This was required by the
  multiple t$ record fix, and has been extended throughout the code base.  In addition, the
  SortChildren method of the CTreeCtrl class is now used instead of a manual bubble sort (the
  bubble sort was always intended as a quick testing piece, and just failed to get replaced
  by production code).  Sorry :(
- Changing zoom on an Image record would cause a crash.  (CDlgTableMap::OnZoomChange)


v1.0.2 2008-01-25
================
NEW STUFF:
- Added item to View menu to display the client size for the currently attached window
  if any.  (Thanks, Winngy)
  

BUG FIXES:
- The Add Font dialog will now default the font group of unknown characters to the text transform group
  of the currently selected region.  (Thanks, Nick Coldhand)  (CDlgTableMap::OnBnClickedCreateFont)



v1.0.1 2008-01-11
================
NEW STUFF:
Nil.


BUG FIXES:
- Refresh button was not refreshing internal cache of screen bits, leading to
  incorrect images being saved.  (Bug identification by many, code  fix by UKbotter)
  Added new method, CMainFrame::SaveBmpPbits, and added calls to this function
  from OnViewConnecttowindow and OnViewRefresh.
  
- Per WinScrape specs, the maximum width of any given individual character in a text 
  transform field is 31 pixels.  Changed MAX_SINGLE_CHAR_WIDTH in structs_defines.h from
  30 to 31 to account for this.

- Added "t0type", "t1type", "t2type", "t3type" as valid symbols.  Although the OpenScrape/
  OpenHoldem engine does not yet support fuzzy text scraping, this have been added for
  handling future capabilities.
  
- Added "c0limits", "c0limits0", "c0limits1", "c0limits2", "c0limits3", "c0limits4", "c0limits5", 
  "c0limits6", "c0limits7", "c0limits8", "c0limits9" as valid symbols.  These were inadventently
  left out in version 1.0.0.

- Removed "h0type", "h1type", "h2type", "h3type" as valid symbols.  These are not used in OH/OS
  as there is only a single hashing algorithm used, and the hash seeds for the types 0-3 are 
  hard coded.
  
  
v1.0.0 2008-01-04
================
- First public release.
