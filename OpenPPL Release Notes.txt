v1.0.4 2012-xx-yy
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- User-defined variables did reset every heartbeat
  instead of once per hand.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- bracketify.pl did not recognize user-defined-variables
  with numbers in the name.
  Thanks to SuperBlak for reporting.
  [THF]
- NumberOfOpponentsLimpingPreflop didn't work due to misplaced brackets.
  Thanks to KaeKruse for reporting and for providing the fix.
  [THF]
- antes are considered "blind-raisers", 
  so "Raises" needs some adaption, if antes are present.
  Unfortunatelly "ante" can be true without antes being visible (as bets)
  on some casinos, which causes incorrect results.
  f$OpenPPL_AntesPresent does now consider only visible antes
  like nopponentsraising does to avoid this  problem.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- Additional spaces and comments in together with "New Symbol XYZ"
  could throw OpenPPL off in the preprocessing state (building a list of symbols).
  Thanks to Relhby for reporting the problem and to PhBot1 
  for suggesting an inprovement.
  Additional white-spaces get now deleted, but comments 
  are still a problem at this place.
  [THF]  

v1.0.3 2012-02-21
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- The sitout command was designed to work with OpenHoldem 2.2.0+,
  which has not yet been released. Support for OH 2.1.9.x has been added.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_RankBitsCommonWithoutTopBit used rankbits instead of
  rankbitscommon. This affected the calculation of 2ndbestBoardCard,
  Have2ndTopPair, Have2ndOverPair, etc.
  Thanks to MarkShmiter for reporting and to KaeKruse and JokeDoke for the fix.
  [THF]
- Some backup-actions didn't work. 
  OpenPPL didn't raise or call when we wanted to go allin,
  but no allin-button was found. This has now been fixed.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]  
- TwoPairOnBoard confused istwopair (boolean) and twopair (a bit-value).
  This did affect the calculation of NutFullHouseOrFourOfAKind.
  Thanks to SteveG1963 for reporting.
  [THF]  
- RaisesSinceLastPlay did use f$OpenPPL_BotsActionsOnThisRound 
  instead of f$OpenPPL_BotsActionsOnThisRoundIncludingChecks.
  This could lead to wrong initializations.
  Thanks to MarkShmiter for reporting.
  [THF]
- InitBotsLastActionPreflop did incorrectly use an undefined BotsLastAction
  for initialization on first orbit preflop and therefore didn't work. 
  To make things worse it did affect BotsLastAction also, 
  because the value of this symbol got cached and later reused. 
  This has now been fixed.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]
- MiddlePosition3, MP2 and MP1 didn't work because of a typo.
  Thanky to Kyo for reporting.
  [THF]
- SuitsOnBoard did also count "undefined" suits.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting and providing good info.
  [THF]

MAINTENANCE:
- Some new option settings for deletion in bracketify.pl.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]

NEW STUFF: 
- Added symbol HavePocketPair.
  [THF]
- New symbols SuitsOnTurn and SuitsOnRiver.
  [THF]
  
  
  
v1.0.2 2012-02-03
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- f$alli confused balance (counted in dollars) and f$OpenPPL_StackSize
  (counted in bets). This could cause incorrect allins.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting and providing the fix.
  [THF]
- OneCardStraightPosibleOnTurn had been missing in the library.
  Thanks to Postenjak for reporting.
  [THF]

  
  
v1.0.1 2012-02-02
=================
BUG FIXES: 
- Automatic betsize-adjustmeant could lead to minraises
  even if we didn't want to raise. Thanks to Postenjak for reporting. 
  [THF]
- HaveTwoPair didn't work. Ace gets set twice in rankbits, 
  as high (bit 14 = ace) and as low (bit 1). This got counted as two pairs.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_LowestBitOfRankBitsCommon did a bit-shift in the wrong direction,
  which affected the calculation of HaveBottomTwoPair.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- f$OpenPPL_NumberOfUnknownSuitedOvercards didn't search for overcards
  to heros holecards, but to the high card of the flush(draw).
  This affected the result of HaveNutFlushDraw, etc.
  Thanks to JokeDoke for reporting. 
  [THF]
- RaisesbeforeOurFirstActionPreflopInbigBlind was wrong.
  This affected the symbol Raises if we were in big blind.
  Thanks to MarkShmiter for reporting.
  [THF]
- Bracketify.pl split InBigBlind etc. into two words,
  even if it was part of a larger lexeme (like UserVillainBigBlind).
  Thanks to Jaredlee for reporting.
  [THF]
  
MAINTENANCE:
- Some symbols like Raises depend on game-history.
  They get calculated and updated whenever the autoplayer acts.
  However: the autoplayer can possibly act more than once per turn
  (because of incorrect delay settings or too many buttons in ManualMode)
  which could throw the calculation off.
  To prevent this we do now remember the gamestate
  (by dealerchair, pot and currentbet) and do only update the symbols
  if at least one of these symbols did change.
  This way the calculation of more complex symbols
  should become way more stable. 
  [THF]
  
NEW STUFF:
- Support for specific suits in hand-expressions, 
  e.g. "WHEN Hand = AcTh" or "WHEN Hand = AdK".
  [THF]
