In the next chapters we will talk about &ldquo;stealth&rdquo;, hiding the fact that a bot plays at your account(s). For most newbies this means a sophisticated technical setup. But before we go into these technical details we should consider the real threats for your botting career.

True, <i>some</i> casinos care about botters, some a bit more and some a bit less. But most casinos accept and even like botters, because they usually are good customers:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
botters provide traffic and playing opportunities for the recreational players
</li>
<li>
they usually extract less money from the eco-system than a good winning player (these greedy evil 2+2 gangsters)
</li>
<li>
some of the botters even bring money to the table. Consider all the stupid newbies wo buy a &ldquo;winning profile&rdquo; from a questionable salesman and then take it to the NL 100 tables. There have been thousands of them in the past at various botting sites and forums.
</li>
<li>
the few long-term botters generate lots of rake for the casino, sometimes even more than their own winnings
</li>
<li>
they are handsome and don’t cause much work for the support team: no questions and no problems (well, as long as the opponents don’t complain...)
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Some casinos like botters so much that they actively seek cooperation. We know at least one small italian gambling site that got in contact with a commercial poker bot seller. The forum owner was enthusiastic — until it turned out that cashouts took at least six months — if they appeared at all. The cooperation never happened.

Some poker sites disabled support for tracking-software; others even invented anonymous tables to protect their fish — and to protect their botters too.
