</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
This chapter contains a detailed explanation of the MyHand-symbols, written by <span class="versalitas">SNGChamp</span> for the Wiki. The MyHand-symbols originally have been developed by <span class="versalitas">Winngy</span> for a fixed-limit-bot (playing $5/$10) and later contributed to OpenHoldem. Basically, the f$mh_str-symbols (e.g. f$mh_str_twopair) return a relative ranking of your hand (hole and common) from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong), but they can be discounted up to 3 points depending on the board-texture. The handstrength symbols are a separate library in text-format and can be downloaded from <a class="FlexURL" href="TODO!!!!!">TODO!!!!!</a>
