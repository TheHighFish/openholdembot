<div class="Unindented">
Autoplayer preferences control how the OpenHoldem Autoplayer functions. See the {The Autoplayer} section for more information.
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Stable frames required</i>: This parameter specifies how many additional simultaneous identical screen scrapes must occur prior to the Autoplayer taking action. Generally, you want to have a stable poker screen before your take action, and this setting will allow various animations and so forth to finish, ensuring that your poker logic has correct game state information prior to making a decision. A frame-delay of 0 would mean that OpenHoldem acts immediatelly after a scrape contains your cards and action buttons. Each additional frame will require a &ldquo;full&rdquo; heartbeat, but as soon as it is your turn the heartbeat-pause will be reduced by 50% to achieve a better combination of stable frames and fast response time.
</li>
<li>
<i>Autoplayer delays: </i>These delays control the little pauses inside a more complex autoplayer action, for example the time between entering a betsize and clicking the raise button.<ul>
<li>
<i>Button click delay: </i>This setting contriols the delay (in milliseconds) between multpile button clicks (double and triple clicks).
</li>
<li>
<i>Select to delete</i>: For SWAG actions, this setting determines how long (in milliseconds) that OpenHoldem will pause after performing the SWAG Select action as specified in the Table Map, and prior to performing the SWAG Delete action as specified in the Table Map. These preferences are not set in the Table Map itself, as these are highly dependent on your CPU and network capacity and utilization, and thus are largely specific to your particular computing environment. 
</li>
<li>
<i>Delete to entry</i>: For SWAG actions, this setting determines how long (in milliseconds) that OpenHoldem will pause after performing the SWAG Delete action as specified in the Table Map and prior to performing the SWAG Entry action. These preferences are not set in the Table Map itself, as these are highly dependent on your CPU and network capacity and utilization, and thus are largely specific to your particular computing environment. 
</li>
<li>
<i>Entry to confirm</i>: For SWAG actions, this setting determines how long (in milliseconds) that OpenHoldem will pause after performing the SWAG Entry action, and prior to performing the SWAG Confirm action as specified in the Table Map. These preferences are not set in the Table Map itself, as these are highly dependent on your CPU and network capacity and utilization, and thus are largely specific to your particular computing environment. 
</li>

</ul>

</li>
<li>
<i>Engage Autoplayer automatically</i> upon connection: This setting instructs OpenHoldem to automatically start the Autoplayer immediatelly after it connects to the table. It is especially no longer necessary to identify the userchair for that. This way it becomes possible to control the option to auto-post blinds and do other minor tasks.
</li>
<li>
<i>Use ‘comma’ instead of ‘dot’</i>: Some casinos require the use of the “comma” as a decimal separator rather than the “dot”. This setting will instruct OpenHoldem to use a comma if needed. Eventually this setting should be moved to the Table Map file itself, as it is casino-specific. 
</li>

In the past OpenHoldem supported some more autoplayer options, namely acting only with known cards, acting only with known balance (potential occlusion of the table) and cancelling autoplayer-actions that got interrupted by other applications or other tables that pop up (so-called loss of input-focus). These options got removed because it makes sense to have these sanity-checks and stability-features always enabled.
