This article explains the basic steps for creating a windows folder that will be as secure as it can possibly be under the NTFS file system. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The general goal is to create a folder that is owned by a single windows user account such that no other user account may access the folder - not even the system or the admin account. 
</div>
<h2 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--1"></a>Prerequisites: 
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
knowledge of creating/modifying user account
</li>
<li>
knowledge of windows explorer
</li>
<li>
knowledge of NTFS permissions 
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
It is assumed that the reader understands how to create/modify a user account and how to use Windows Explorer to navigate folder space and how to modify folder properties/permissions.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--2"></a>Configuration Steps
</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Login to your admin account 
</li>
<li>
Create/decide target account (from admin account). This account will own the hyper-safe folder. For the purpose of this example, the account name "ninja" will be used. The "ninja" account must meet the following requirements: <ol>
<li>
it cannot be the Administrator account 
</li>
<li>
it cannot be part of the Administrator group 
</li>
<li>
it cannot be part of any group except the default users group. 
</li>

</ol>

</li>
<li>
If you need/want to create a special "ninja" account then do that first according to the restrictions above. If the account already exists then make sure it meets the requirements above. 
</li>
<li>
Create the target folder (from admin account). Your goal here is to create/decide the target folder. In an ideal world you would create a top level folder on an empty local (non-shared/not-networked) hard drive where "ninja" has full control over that disk. If this is not possible then the next best thing is a top level folder on a non-shared drive. If this is not possible then you must select a location where "ninja" will have access to the parent folder so that it can access its private folder.
</li>
<li>
Permissions (from admin account) <ol>
<li>
Select the properties for the folder and select the security tab add "ninja" to the access list and grant "ninja" full control. Remove all other users/groups from the access list, which will effectively shut out the entire world. There should be exactly one account in the access list and that account should be “&lt;host&gt;/ninja" 
</li>
<li>
Uncheck/unselect "Allow inheritable permissions from parent to propagate to this object". The reason for this is that you want this folder and it’s permissions to be the root node for all children below it. If you do not do this then permissions defined for the parent above your root folder will filter down to your folder and the children in your folder and you do not want that. Note that you cannot give ownership of objects in NTFS, you can only "take" ownership with the account you’re currently using. You will take ownership of the folder later when you login to the "ninja" account. 
</li>

</ol>

</li>
<li>
Logout of the admin account 
</li>
<li>
Login to your "ninja" account 
</li>
<li>
Ownership (from ninja account) <ol>
<li>
Select the properties for your "safe" folder and verify that "ninja" is the only account in the access list. 
</li>
<li>
Click the advanced button and goto the owner tab and select the "ninja" account. 
</li>
<li>
Check "Replace owner ..." and click "Apply". You should now be the full owner of your "safe" folder and everything below it. 
</li>

</ol>

</li>
<li>
Permissions (from ninja account) <ol>
<li>
Click the permissions tab and check "Reset permissions on all child objects ...". 
</li>
<li>
Uncheck "Allow inheritable permissions from parent ..." (note this should already be unchecked since you did that from the admin account), then click apply. This will go quickly if the folder is empty. It can take seconds or minutes or more depending on the children folder tree below you. 
</li>

</ol>

</li>
<li>
Verify. Create a test child folder inside your "safe" folder, view the properites and verify that "ninja" is the owner with full control and that no other account has access. If this is not the case then you missed a step above (probably the "Allow inheritable permissions ..." in step 4).
</li>
<li>
Logout of the "ninja" account 
</li>
<li>
Login to the admin account 
</li>
<li>
Verify. Try to access the "safe" folder. You should not be able to access the contents of the folder nor modify the folder properties/permissions. As an admin you can still take ownership of the folder but until then the admin access is denied.
</li>

</ol>

<div class="Unindented">
If you have the resources and you want the best possible solution then you should dedicate an entire physical hard drive to your stealth department. That drive should not be the bootable system drive, but should be a secondary drive. You should consume all 4 primary partitions on your stealth drive by creating 4 primary partitions of roughly equal size. Each partition should be formatted with <a class="IndexReference" name="entry-NTFS-0" href="#index-NTFS">↓</a>NTFS only (not FAT or FAT32). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You should then make the "ninja" account the owner of all 4 partitions and the sole account with access. There should be no other accounts listed in the access list. The drives should not be networked or shared. If you do this you will notice that your admin account cannot even read the device label and that the 4 hard drives will be seen only as "local-drive". All access from any accounts other than "ninja" will be denied.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The benefit of this setup is that once you construct a hard drive like this you don’t have to worry about permissions ever again in the context of that drive - you know that anything you do on that drive must be done from the "ninja" account and that any folder/files created on that drive are entirely safe.
