"Universal.tm" is a universal tablemap that accepts every table.
It is meant as a tool to connect to new casinos and shoot replay-frames when you build a new map.

Be careful if you use it and don't put in into the standard scraper folder: 
the autoconnector would then be willing to connect to any kind of random "table".

For clarification (as some people didn't get it)
* turn auto-connection completely off (preferences->auto-connector).
* load the TM manually (don't put it in the scraper-folder!
    the auto-connector would then connect to any "table" later)
* press the replay-buttons if you see a good situation
    (or "every single heartbeat", if you don't mind LOTS of large frames;
    but automatically "on my turn" does not work with an empty TM obviously).
	
Good luck!
